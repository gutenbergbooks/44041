<h1 title="">THE MYSTERY OF
<br />ARNOLD HALL</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />PAT&rsquo;S CHANCE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Will you go, Patricia?&rdquo; called Mrs. Randall
from the living room, one cool evening late
in August, as the doorbell rang imperatively.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m starting a fire in the grate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the dining room across the hall, where
she had been putting away the last of the supper
dishes, hurried a tall slender girl, whose
short wavy yellow hair and big brown eyes
were set off to perfection by a green jersey
dress. Expecting to see one of the neighbors
when the door was opened, she was startled
into an involuntary gasp as a messenger thrust
forward a special delivery letter, inquiring
curtly&mdash;&ldquo;Miss Patricia Randall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;es.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sign here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Patricia signed his book, closed the door, and
walked slowly into the living room staring
down at the unexpected missive in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Pat?&rdquo; inquired her mother,
glancing up from the hearth rug where she
knelt trying to coax a blaze from a bed of charcoal
and paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A special delivery letter&mdash;for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Randall in surprise.
&ldquo;From whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied her daughter,
frowning in a puzzled fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, open it and find out. Don&rsquo;t stand
staring at it like that,&rdquo; urged her mother
briskly.</p>
<p>Patricia sank into a low tapestry chair beside
the fireplace and tore open the envelope. As
she drew out the single sheet it contained, a
slip dropped from it onto her lap. Still holding
the folded letter she picked up the slip and
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cashier&rsquo;s check for a <i>thousand dollars</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Randall, reaching for the
yellow paper to read it for herself. &ldquo;Look at
the letter, quick, and see who sent it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a line. &lsquo;For Patricia Randall to
spend on a year at Granard College.&rsquo; Oh&mdash;why&mdash;Mums!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia flung herself on her mother so suddenly
that Mrs. Randall lost her balance, and
the two fell in a heap on the rug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mary! Patricia!&rdquo; ejaculated a horrified
masculine voice from the doorway. &ldquo;What in
the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dad!&rdquo; cried the girl, springing up and
giving a helping hand to her mother. With
scarcely more effort than that of her daughter
Mrs. Randall regained her feet, and they stood
facing Mr. Randall&rsquo;s astonished gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at this!&rdquo; Patricia thrust the
magic papers into his hand. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it marvelous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Randall read the brief message, turned
the check over and over as if to discover its
sender by inspecting it from all sides, and then
looked inquiringly at his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a joke of some kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joke!&rdquo; retorted Patricia in disgust. &ldquo;I
should say not! A messenger just brought it,
special delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange, very strange,&rdquo; commented her
father, shaking his head. &ldquo;Do you know anything
about it, Mary?&rdquo; addressing his wife,
with a suspicious look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I most certainly do not. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to know that I don&rsquo;t. Where
would I get that much money? Didn&rsquo;t we send
Pat here to Brentwood College last year because
we couldn&rsquo;t afford to send her away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your shirt on, Dad!&rdquo; laughed Patricia.
&ldquo;Keep your shirt on, and say I may
go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what to say,&rdquo; replied the
puzzled man, sinking heavily into his favorite
chair, and pulling his pipe out of his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose,&rdquo; began Patricia, perching
on the arm of her father&rsquo;s chair, &ldquo;that Aunt
Betsy could have gotten big-hearted and sent
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat!&rdquo; cried her mother derisively. &ldquo;Of
course not. She has all she can do to keep Ted
in college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be rather nice for me, having Ted at
Granard,&rdquo; mused Patricia, recalling her
cousin&rsquo;s beguiling ways and good looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And having Aunt Betsy there to keep an
eye on both of you,&rdquo; added her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some eye! She&rsquo;ll probably never know I&rsquo;m
there,&rdquo; laughed Patricia. &ldquo;Darling Ted takes
up all of her time and attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two women,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Randall
peevishly, &ldquo;seem to have this affair all
settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, darling, we felt quite sure
you would let me go,&rdquo; laughed Patricia, ruffling
up his hair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; bending down to look pleadingly into
his eyes. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve longed to go out of
town to college where I could live in a dorm.
Not that I don&rsquo;t like living at home, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand,&rdquo; interrupted her mother;
&ldquo;you need not be apologetic.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we knew who sent the money,
though,&rdquo; said Patricia, frowning earnestly. &ldquo;It
must be somebody who knows all about us, but
I can&rsquo;t think of a soul who could or would
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall investigate, of course,&rdquo; began her
father, after some thought; &ldquo;but if nothing can
be found out about the donor of this wonderful
gift, it seems to me that since the money has
been sent to you for a special purpose, and
sent in such a manner, the only course open
to us is to use it as stipulated, and not make
any further effort to discover its sender.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but, Dad! It&rsquo;s so tantalizing,&rdquo; wailed
his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know; but, Patricia, when you have a
secret, you don&rsquo;t like to have anyone try to
guess it, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;o.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the same thing. Just do your best
to be worthy of such a generous gift and wait
for its sender to reveal himself when he
chooses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is quite right, Pat,&rdquo; agreed
Mrs. Randall; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like to add one more
suggestion: that you do not discuss the matter
with anyone else but us. It&rsquo;s romantic, and
your inclination will be to let your new companions
in on the secret, but I think you will
be wise if you keep it to yourself; unless, of
course, some unusual circumstance arises.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>Patricia thought soberly for a few minutes,
then said with a sigh, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re right,
Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll have any trouble transferring
your credits and getting into the Sophomore
class?&rdquo; asked her father presently, after
another long pause, while each was busy with
his own thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I&rsquo;ll go to see the Dean
the first thing tomorrow morning, and I&rsquo;ll have
to write for a room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll have to shop and sew,&rdquo; added
Mrs. Randall, almost as eagerly as her
daughter.</p>
<p class="tb">After Pat had gone to bed to lie awake anticipating
all kinds of unknown adventures, Mr.
and Mrs. Randall had a long serious talk over
the dying fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you feel satisfied to let her go?&rdquo; inquired
Mrs. Randall anxiously as they finally
rose to go upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can do any different.
And who knows what this opportunity may
mean to Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could only be sure that everything was
all right, and that no harm would come to the
child,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Randall, running her fingers
through her hair, a habit when troubled
over anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mary, what harm could come to her?
She&rsquo;ll be living with lots of other students
under the direct supervision of the house
chaperon and the Dean; and Betsy is right near
the college. But of course if you don&rsquo;t want
her to go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <i>do</i>&mdash;at least I haven&rsquo;t the heart to
deprive her of the fulfillment of one of her
dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Randall locked the front door, put out
the lights, and followed his wife up the long
stairway. At the door of their room Mrs. Randall
paused, grasped his arm and whispered
cautiously, with an eye on Pat&rsquo;s door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
willing to give Pats her chance, but, just the
same, John Randall, I wish she were going back
to Brentwood. I have a presentiment that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your presentiments!&rdquo; ejaculated
Mr. Randall, pushing her gently but
firmly ahead of him into their room. &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The weeks that followed were very exciting
ones for Patricia. Her days were filled to the
brim with shopping, sewing, making last calls
on old friends, and finally, packing. So many
evenings were taken up with farewell parties
that Mr. Randall complained that he never saw
his daughter any more; that, as far as her parents
were concerned, she might as well have
gone to college the night she received the
money.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear,&rdquo; remonstrated his wife soothingly,
&ldquo;all her friends want to entertain for
her, and she can&rsquo;t very well refuse any of their
invitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she tonight?&rdquo; grumbled Mr.
Randall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carolyn is giving a dinner dance at the
Club. Poor Carolyn! She&rsquo;s quite disturbed
over having Pat go away. They have been
such pals ever since they were little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat might ask Carolyn down for a week end
some time this year. She and her mother have
been more than good to our girl. Besides, I
don&rsquo;t want Pat to be so taken up with the new
life and new friends that she will cast aside all
her old ties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will, John. Of course just
at first her whole mind will be on Granard, but
after the novelty wears off&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking,&rdquo; interrupted her husband,
who evidently had his mind on something
else, &ldquo;that it would be nice for Pats to have a
little car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John! How &lsquo;galumptious&rsquo; as Pat says.
Could we manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. We&rsquo;ll have the money we expected
to spend on her year at Brentwood, and
Everet Schuyler has a coach he&rsquo;s very anxious
to sell. If I can drive any kind of a bargain
with him, I think I&rsquo;ll do it. Of course don&rsquo;t say
anything to Pat. I thought we might drive
down some week end, and surprise her with it;
and then come back on the train.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever happen to think of such
a thing?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Randall, knitting very
fast on the green sweater she was making for
her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t been blind to the fact that
more than half of the college girls here have
some kind of a car, and I often wished I could
get Pat one. Never been able to, before, but now
I guess we can swing it. It will be a saving,
too; for she can drive back and forth whenever
she has a vacation, and save carfare. And
maybe, once in a while, she could come home
for a week end?&rdquo; he added, hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; Mrs. Randall smiled and leaned
forward to pat his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to Schuyler&rsquo;s now and look
at the bus,&rdquo; proposed Mr. Randall ten minutes
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed his wife, laying aside
her work and getting briskly out of her easy
chair.</p>
<p class="tb">If Patricia had not been so absorbed in her
own affairs she would certainly have wondered
the next day what ailed her parents; for there
was such an air of suppressed excitement about
them that vented itself in significant glances
and knowing smiles. The thrill of buying her
ticket, however, made Patricia oblivious to all
else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take a sleeper,&rdquo; asked her
mother, &ldquo;and get a good rest on the way down?
You&rsquo;ve been up so late every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; retorted Patricia decidedly.
&ldquo;When I travel I want my eyes wide
open so I won&rsquo;t miss a single thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her positive decision recurred to her three
days later as she snuggled deep into her comfortable
chair, with a sigh of satisfaction, a
sigh which was unceremoniously cut short by
a very big yawn. The farewells at the station
had been exciting and gratifying, but yet something
of a strain. Almost all of her crowd had
assembled to see her off, bearing gifts of candy,
fruit, books, and magazines; her mother had
clung to her till the very last minute, and her
father had fussed about time tables, porters,
tips, and a dozen other things. It had seemed
as if she were being torn into a dozen pieces
trying to pay attention to everybody. Now the
train was bearing her rapidly away from Dad
and Mother and all the dear old friends toward
a new life at Granard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d have been wiser to have followed
Mother&rsquo;s suggestion about the sleeper,&rdquo;
she thought, as she tried to stifle another great
yawn. &ldquo;Maybe if I take a little nap now, I&rsquo;ll
feel fresh for the rest of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>Turning her chair toward the window, and
leaning back, her hands on the broad arms, she
was almost immediately floating in a delicious
sea of semi-unconsciousness which became
deeper and deeper until she was completely
lost to the world about her. After a while, however,
a most persistent dream began to disturb
her peaceful sleep, a dream about a soft grey
kitten whose silky fur she kept stroking, stroking
until her hand was tired; but yet she could
not stop. After a time she began to realize
that she was dreaming, and made a desperate
effort to free herself from the world of sleep
by closing her fingers sharply on the little
animal&rsquo;s neck and giving it a shove.</p>
<p>Then with a sudden start at some movement
close to her she sat bolt upright and opened
her eyes just in time to see a pair of long legs,
the ankles clad in grey silk socks, hastily removing
themselves from the ledge beside her
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; she thought, horror-stricken.
&ldquo;I do hope <i>those</i> weren&rsquo;t the kitten!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />ANNE</h2>
<p>Swinging her chair sharply about to face
the aisle, she met the amused gaze of a red-haired
girl of about her own age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; begged Patricia impulsively,
leaning forward, &ldquo;was I&mdash;doing anything&mdash;unusual
while I was asleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say you were,&rdquo; responded the girl, smiling
broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you were&mdash;stroking the ankles of
that young man back of you as if your life
depended on it,&rdquo; choked the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Patricia, in great distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! Then suddenly you pinched the poor
fellow, and I thought I&rsquo;d just <i>die</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the man in question rose and
hurried down the aisle toward the smoker.
With crimson face, Patricia watched the slight
boyish figure, with its crown of smooth yellow
hair, disappear before she again addressed her
neighbor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m embarrassed to death! What <i>must</i> he
think of me? I can&rsquo;t apologize for something
I didn&rsquo;t know I was doing; and if I try to explain,
it will look as if we were trying to scrape
up an acquaintance. What would you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just let it go, and try to forget it,&rdquo;
advised the other girl, raising up in her chair
to lower the shade a little; for the sun was shining
full upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose the rest of these people saw
me?&rdquo; persisted Patricia, glancing anxiously
around the car.</p>
<p>There were not many other passengers; an
old lady, apparently absorbed in a weighty-looking
volume; a couple of middle-aged men,
with their heads close together, evidently discussing
some important question; a young
mother, absorbed in the baby in her arms; and
a scared-looking, awkward girl, who gazed
moodily out of the window, occasionally munching
a chocolate from a box in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied the red-haired
girl, settling herself anew in her chair, and
smoothing out the skirt of her dark green suit.
&ldquo;I probably shouldn&rsquo;t have, if I hadn&rsquo;t been
watching you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watching me?&rdquo; repeated Patricia, opening
her brown eyes very wide in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and wondering if by any chance you
were going to Granard College.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, but what in the world made you
think so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you looked like a college girl, some way,
and then being on this train, which, this time
of year, is a favorite one for the Granard students.
Don&rsquo;t know where they all are today,
though. Are you just entering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and no,&rdquo; laughed Patricia. &ldquo;I did my
Freshman work at Brentwood; so I&rsquo;m entering
the Soph class here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations! Welcome to the class of
19&mdash;. I&rsquo;m one of your classmates-to-be. Anne
Ford, at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Patricia Randall, and I&rsquo;m very
glad to get acquainted with some one before
I get to Granard. I confess I have stage fright
at the prospect of meeting so many strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that bother you. The girls are
easy to get on with, and you&rsquo;ll soon feel as if
you&rsquo;d always been at Granard,&rdquo; said Anne
carelessly.</p>
<p>Patricia realized, however, that it would not
be quite so simple to break into a class whose
cliques and customs had had a whole year&rsquo;s
start before she came on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to choose Granard?&rdquo;
inquired Anne curiously. &ldquo;Do you know anyone
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin,&rdquo; replied Patricia, breathing
a prayer of thanks for the second question
which enabled her to disregard the first. &ldquo;Ted
Carter; do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted Carter! I should say I do!&rdquo; exclaimed
Anne, adding, quickly and somewhat possessively,
&ldquo;Ted&rsquo;s my best boy friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How nice!&rdquo; commented Patricia so heartily
that all the suspicions which had arisen in
Anne&rsquo;s mind as to possible claims on the fascinating
Teddy were promptly allayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on over here,&rdquo; suggested Anne, turning
a vacant chair to face her; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll
have a cozy chat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia gladly accepted the invitation, and
as she settled herself with one foot tucked
under her, a habit whenever she wished to be
especially comfortable, Anne asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know yet where you&rsquo;re to room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Arnold Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i>?&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, gazing at
Patricia in astonishment. &ldquo;You certainly must
have some pull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; inquired Patricia, in a puzzled
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Arnold Hall&rsquo;s the best dorm at
Granard, and there&rsquo;s always a waiting list for
it. You&rsquo;re a lucky girl to be able to break right
into it. My reservation was made while I was
still in high school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you live there? I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad!&rdquo;
There was no mistaking the note of gratification
in Patricia&rsquo;s tone, nor the admiring gaze
of her brown eyes which rested somewhat shyly
upon her new acquaintance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Anne smiled in the manner of one who is so
accustomed to being popular that it has long
ceased to be exciting. There was something
unusual about this new girl, evidently, or old
Hattersley would never have let her get into
Arnold Hall. It evidently wasn&rsquo;t money; for
though Patricia&rsquo;s clothes were in good taste,
they were not expensive. She had no friends
there, except her cousin. Perhaps it was scholarship,
or some powerful influence from Brentwood
or high school.</p>
<p>Patricia, meanwhile, was wondering what
Anne would say if she were to tell her that
when Dad had written for a room for Patricia,
the registrar, somebody by the name of Hattersley,
had promptly replied that one had already
been reserved for her in Arnold Hall. They
had speculated on the strange fact for days,
and had been forced to leave the mystery unsolved,
just as they had the arrival of the
check.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know Aunt Betsy?&rdquo; inquired Patricia,
presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not personally,&rdquo; replied Anne, smiling
broadly; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve heard of her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant you have,&rdquo; giggled Patricia.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as good as gold, but most awfully funny.
You never know what she&rsquo;s going to say or do
next. We say she has only three interests: Ted,
and Ted, and Ted. They used to live near us
in Brentwood, but when my cousin won a scholarship
at Granard, she rented her house and
took an apartment down here so she could give
Ted all the comforts of home during his course.
She meant well, of course; but I feel sort of
sorry for Ted. I fancy he&rsquo;d rather be a bit
freer. One night during his Freshman year he
stayed out to dinner and for the evening without
telling her; so she ran all over the campus
looking for him, quite sure that the terrible
Sophs had imprisoned him somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that story,&rdquo; laughed Anne.
&ldquo;He was at the Zeta Omega House&mdash;that&rsquo;s
right next to Arnold Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Aunt Betsy heard that I was coming
down, she wrote Dad that she could take me in
just as well as not, and that I&rsquo;d be far more
comfortable with her than in any dorm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you preferred to be less comfortable,&rdquo;
interrupted Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did. I&rsquo;ve wanted to live in a
dorm ever since I knew what college was. Tell
me something about Granard so I won&rsquo;t be
quite so ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne began to talk animatedly of college
affairs, and Patricia&rsquo;s eyes got bigger and bigger
and her cheeks redder and redder as she
became more and more interested. Neither of
the girls noticed that the blond youth had returned
to his chair and was watching them
intently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, glancing
out of the window a couple of hours later, as
the train began to slow down. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize
that we were nearly in. We change to the bus
here at Plainville. Come on! They make only
a two-minute stop here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>Grabbing their bags, the two girls hurried
out of the train onto a long platform splashed
with big drops of rain. At the end farthest
from the train a bus was waiting for passengers;
and just as they reached it, the rain, now
driven by a brisk wind, began to fall in torrents.
Laughing and breathless, they scrambled
up the steps of the bus and sank into seats
near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes a friend of yours,&rdquo; remarked
Anne, peering out of the doorway at other travelers,
scurrying across the glistening platform.</p>
<p>Thinking that perhaps Ted had come that
far to meet her, Patricia leaned forward just
as the young man with the light hair bounded
up the steps and collided sharply with her outstretched
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say&mdash;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry,&rdquo; he cried,
flushing brilliantly. &ldquo;I hope I didn&rsquo;t hurt
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least!&rdquo; lied Patricia curtly, trying
desperately to fight back tears. Ever since
she could remember, any sudden blow or fall
had made her cry, whether she was really badly
hurt or not. It was a most embarrassing habit,
now that she was grown up. As she elaborately
straightened her little brown hat which was
over one ear, and tried to recover her poise,
the youth passed on to the other end of the bus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder when and where your next encounter
will be,&rdquo; observed Anne, as the driver
closed the doors and started the big bus.
&ldquo;Three times&mdash;you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, I hope,&rdquo; replied Patricia emphatically,
little dreaming what the future held in
store for her. &ldquo;Does this bus take us right to
college?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, only to the foot of the hill about one-half
mile from the campus. We&rsquo;ll be there in
an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you a room mate?&rdquo; inquired Patricia,
a few minutes later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have one of the three singles on the
first floor. Where are you to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I hope that it will be near
you, and that I&rsquo;ll have a room mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Anne, idly tracing designs on
the steamed window beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve always wanted one. It&rsquo;s a bit
lonesome, being an only child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes you&rsquo;d wish you were,&rdquo; laughed
Anne, &ldquo;if your sister tried to boss you as mine
frequently does. Joan and I are usually pretty
good friends, but once in so often we have a
flare-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to get along peaceably
with a room mate, if I have one,&rdquo; said
Patricia earnestly. &ldquo;Maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t though.
I guess I must be pretty well spoiled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so worried!&rdquo; ordered Anne.
&ldquo;And, by the way, don&rsquo;t take to heart everything
the girls may say. Living all together,
as we do, we are pretty frank at times, but
everybody takes it in good part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the bus stopped, it was still raining,
and the two girls ran hastily across the muddy
road to a small rustic shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Anne, shaking her wet umbrella.
&ldquo;Evidently none of the girls have come
down to meet the bus. Don&rsquo;t blame &rsquo;em much
on such a &lsquo;nausty&rsquo; day. So we&rsquo;ll have to climb
the hill by ourselves and take our own bags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bags!&rdquo; exclaimed Patricia, clutching
Anne&rsquo;s arm, as she opened her green umbrella
preparatory to starting up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, bags; what about them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t mine! I must have left it on
the bus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; ejaculated Anne forcefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do a thing but wait and see if
the driver finds it, and brings it back on his
next trip. Is your name on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne closed her umbrella again, set her own
bag in a corner, and loosened her jacket.
&ldquo;Might as well sit down, I suppose,&rdquo; she commented,
leading the way to a bench across the
back of the shelter. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be another
bus for an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you needn&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; offered Patricia
heroically. &ldquo;I can wait alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if I&rsquo;ll let you; but I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied
Anne, pushing back some little red curls which
had escaped from under the brim of her smart
green hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty good of you,&rdquo; said Patricia
gratefully; for she had hated to think of staying
here all alone for a full hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never desert a friend in distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A friend in need,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of friends,&rdquo; interrupted Anne,
&ldquo;what became of the blond youth? I didn&rsquo;t see
him get off the bus; did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he might have just the same. I was
too excited over my bag to think of anything
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have gone on to Mendon, but I
doubt it. I&rsquo;ve never seen him before, but he
looked to me like a college fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I did,&rdquo; began Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never looked like a college fellow in
your life!&rdquo; retorted Anne, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean,&rdquo; said Patricia, flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand what you mean; but, just the
same, I am curious to know what became of the
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>The time passed more quickly than they
thought it would, and both were surprised when
a grey bus loomed up in the distance. As soon
as it came to a stop, Patricia ran out in the
rain to question the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find a bag?&rdquo; she demanded
eagerly.</p>
<p>The fat, good-natured driver wrinkled up his
forehead thoughtfully and then nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; she declared, with relief.
&ldquo;Please give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Miss; but I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; inquired Patricia, a bit impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s back at the station. I didn&rsquo;t
know whose it was, and we have to turn everything
in. Then it has to be identified by its
owner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Anne, who had been the center
of a group of girls who had gotten off of the
bus, left her friends and came to Patricia&rsquo;s
rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mike,&rdquo; she said, smiling sweetly up at the
big driver, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t you bring Miss Randall&rsquo;s
bag down on your next trip? We don&rsquo;t want
to go all the way back to town now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />&ldquo;HILL TOP&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I guess perhaps I can manage it, Miss
Ford; since it&rsquo;s you who asks it,&rdquo; replied the
man, smiling admiringly down at the pretty
face upturned to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, a heap! We&rsquo;ll be waiting right
here for it. Now,&rdquo; turning to Patricia and
leading her over to the three girls she had just
left, &ldquo;I want you to meet some of my friends.
They&rsquo;re all Arnold Hall girls. This is Lucile
Evans,&rdquo; stopping in front of a slight, pale-faced
girl whose red lips protruded in a pout,
which, Patricia later learned, was perpetual.
Without a change of expression, she bowed
rather indifferently at Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Jane Temple,&rdquo; announced the second
girl, advancing cordially as if to make up for
Lucile&rsquo;s rudeness.</p>
<p>As Patricia took Jane&rsquo;s hand and looked
into a pair of honest grey eyes, and at the
good-humored smiling lips, she felt that here
was a girl to whom one could always tie in
any emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last of this trio is Hazel Leland,&rdquo; continued
Anne; &ldquo;our beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Anne, don&rsquo;t embarrass me,&rdquo; protested
the girl, smiling gayly at Patricia.</p>
<p>She <i>was</i> a beauty; big, starry grey eyes;
lovely, light brown hair which curled all over
her head in little rings, like a baby&rsquo;s; and a
figure as slight and lithe as a boy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The newcomer in our midst,&rdquo; concluded
Anne, putting her arm around Patricia, &ldquo;is
Patricia Randall, formerly of Brentwood, now
a member of the illustrious Sophomore class
of Granard; and, what&rsquo;s more, an inmate of
Arnold Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; ejaculated Hazel, patting
Patricia on the back, while the other two girls
shot surprised, inquiring glances at Anne, who
pretended not to see them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go on up?&rdquo; drawled Lucile,
opening her mouth for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to wait for Patricia&rsquo;s bag,&rdquo; replied
Anne quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was Lucile&rsquo;s brief response; but some
way there was an unpleasant note in it, which
made Patricia flush uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of my detaining you all,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;I can wait by myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, darling,&rdquo; protested Anne, &ldquo;we&rsquo;d
never be so unhospitable to a new member of
our household as that. You needn&rsquo;t wait if you
prefer not to, Lu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without another word, Lucile picked up her
bag and started haughtily up the steep hill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo; asked Anne,
watching the blue-coated figure ascending the
slope as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been
out of sorts all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she met some youth last night who was
coming down here on the two o&rsquo;clock bus
today,&rdquo; said Hazel quickly; &ldquo;and when he
didn&rsquo;t, show up, Lu got peeved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She usually isn&rsquo;t sufficiently interested in
men to care whether or not one breaks a date,&rdquo;
said Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; replied Hazel, &ldquo;she probably
wants something of him. Lu&rsquo;s the limit,&rdquo; she
continued, turning to Patricia, &ldquo;for getting
just what she wants without lifting a finger.
Everybody waits on her, and she sits back and
accepts service like a queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t give Lu a bad reputation,&rdquo;
said Jane reprovingly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a bad kid
when you get to know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not bad,&rdquo; agreed Hazel, &ldquo;but&mdash;as selfish
as they&rsquo;re made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; cried Anne, pointing excitedly to
the top of the hill.</p>
<p>There against the green background stood
the blue-coated object of their discussion, and
a grey-clad masculine figure with yellow hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy friend at last!&rdquo; exclaimed Hazel.
&ldquo;He must have been waiting for her at &lsquo;Hill
Top.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I only hope that he treats her to
something real sweet,&rdquo; laughed Jane. &ldquo;&lsquo;Hill
Top,&rsquo;&rdquo; she added, addressing herself to Patricia
who was gazing apprehensively at the
couple, &ldquo;is a little tea room up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youth was the young man who was the
object of her caresses on the train, and Patricia
flushed hotly to think what a story he&rsquo;d
have to tell Lucile if he chose, and what fun
they&rsquo;d all make of her. She glanced at Anne,
but that young lady displayed no signs of ever
having seen the man before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up and have a soda, or something,&rdquo;
proposed Hazel, looking at her watch.
&ldquo;Plenty of time before Mike gets back. Our
stuff will be all right in the corner over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia opened her mouth to refuse, although
she <i>was</i> hungry; but when the other
girls hailed the suggestion with glee, she closed
it again without voicing her objections, and followed
them silently up the hill. Almost on the
edge perched a small grey house with lavender
shutters, and on its long, screened porch stood
a grey, weather-beaten spinning wheel and a
lavender table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat out here,&rdquo; proposed Anne, leading
the way to the end of the porch.</p>
<p>Patricia could have hugged her; for she
didn&rsquo;t want to go in and meet her fellow traveler.
He might even think she was following
him up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.,&rdquo; agreed Hazel, slipping into a chair.
&ldquo;You go in and get a waitress, Nanny. I&rsquo;m
starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; replied Anne. &ldquo;There was no
diner on the train, and all Patricia and I had
was some sweet chocolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so hungry&mdash;&rdquo; began Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> are not hungry! Did I hear aright?&rdquo;
asked Hazel. &ldquo;That girl can always eat,&rdquo; she
added, to Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see I got pretty well fed up at
home during the summer, but just wait until
I&rsquo;ve been here a couple of weeks, and I&rsquo;ll get
back to my old habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meals at Horton Hall are the limit,&rdquo;
said Hazel, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;ll find to your sorrow,
Patricia. We spend all our spare change, and
some we can&rsquo;t well spare, at the various tea
rooms around College Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we have?&rdquo; asked Anne, returning
at that moment, followed by a waitress, and
sitting down opposite Hazel. &ldquo;This is on me,
to celebrate Patricia&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicken patty, French pastry, and iced
tea,&rdquo; replied Hazel promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waffles, maple syrup, and ice cream,&rdquo; said
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible! Think of your &lsquo;figger,&rsquo; darling.
You&rsquo;ve put on about ten pounds this summer,&rdquo;
teased Hazel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take shrimp salad, Danish pastry, and
pineapple sherbet,&rdquo; said Patricia, when Anne
looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicken sandwiches, brownies, and ginger
ale for me,&rdquo; said Anne, completing the order.
As the waitress disappeared, she leaned both
elbows on the table and announced in low tones,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not in the dining room, but Lu&rsquo;s bag
is in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they&rsquo;re out in the coffee room,&rdquo;
suggested Hazel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; objected Jane quickly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want them to think we&rsquo;re spying on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if we are,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;Maybe
they&rsquo;ll come out while we&rsquo;re still here; and,
in the meantime, let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lunch took much longer than they had anticipated,
and when Patricia, suddenly remembering
her bag, glanced at her watch, she was
surprised to find that the hands pointed at
3:30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls!&rdquo; she cried, pushing back her chair
and getting up so quickly that Hazel jumped.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s half past three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll settle the bill and
catch up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other three hurried down the hill, and
when Anne caught up to them at the foot,
Patricia was pointing in speechless dismay at
a grey bus rounding the curve toward Mendon.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; she wailed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Mike left your bag in the shelter,&rdquo;
suggested Jane comfortingly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A thorough search revealed no trace of the
missing bag, either inside of the shelter or out;
and Patricia bemoaned the carelessness which
had, a second time that day, betrayed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait until I see Mike!&rdquo; stormed Anne.
&ldquo;He should have had sense enough to leave it,
even if we were not right on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially when ours are here,&rdquo; agreed
Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we do with our own is entirely up to
us,&rdquo; said Jane slowly. &ldquo;If Mike had orders
to put the bag in its owner&rsquo;s hands, he couldn&rsquo;t
very well do otherwise. Suppose we go on
up and telephone the terminal to see what can
be done about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea! All right with you, Pat?&rdquo; asked
Hazel. Then, as Patricia nodded, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get
going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; advised Anne. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it
some way; and if not tonight, we can manage
between us all to fit you out. We&rsquo;re used to
that; aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say so,&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;Why, Hazel,
here, went to a dance last winter in a dress Mrs.
Vincent lent her. That&rsquo;s our chaperon; and as
far as borrowing and lending go, she&rsquo;s surely
one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Just as they reached the top of the hill again,
Lucile sauntered down the tea-room steps
alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the boy friend, Lu?&rdquo; called Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo;
replied Lucile haughtily, as she joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to bluff,&rdquo; ordered Hazel; &ldquo;we
all saw him meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one on you,&rdquo; scoffed Lucile. &ldquo;He
stopped to ask me the way to Arnold Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arnold Hall!&rdquo; chorused the others. &ldquo;What
in the name of fortune does he want there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you knew?&rdquo; jeered Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she putting something over on us?
Where do you suppose he went?&rdquo; whispered
Hazel to Jane, but the latter only shrugged
her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I telephone the terminal?&rdquo; inquired
Anne, when they came to the little building
which served as post office for the college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; replied Patricia gratefully;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll know better what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on,&rdquo; announced Lucile, as they
paused to wait for Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to it!&rdquo; retorted Hazel. &ldquo;Look, Pat,
that red brick building on the corner is Horton
Hall, the dorm for the music students. In the
basement is the college dining room, where each
dorm has a certain section. Over there, across
the street, that grey building with all the steps
is the auditorium, where the entertainments
and meetings are held.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did they say, Anne?&rdquo; interrupted
Jane, as Anne rejoined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talked to Mike himself. His sub was on
the earlier bus, and he was afraid to leave the
bag, since there was no one to take it. Mike
will bring it out on his next run. I told him to
give it to anybody who was coming up to the
college; then we won&rsquo;t have to go down for it.
There&rsquo;ll be heaps of students on the last bus,
and Mike knows most of them. All right, Pat?&rdquo;
as the girl looked a bit doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she replied; but way down deep in
her heart she felt that she would be much
happier when her property was once more safe
in her own hands. &ldquo;But it serves me right for
being so careless,&rdquo; she thought, with characteristic
honesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; urged Hazel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy to get
to the Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much to Patricia&rsquo;s surprise they turned away
from the college buildings and down a side
street. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; she finally
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Arnold Hall, of course,&rdquo; replied Jane.
&ldquo;Oh, I forgot that you didn&rsquo;t know where it
was. You see, all the dorms, frat and sorority
houses are on streets fairly near the college,
but not right on the campus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you&rsquo;d all be dead, climbing
these hills,&rdquo; commented Patricia, as they
started up Wentworth Street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The whole town is built on hills, and the
college is on the highest one; but you&rsquo;ll get
used to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they went up a brick walk leading to a
big three-story house near the end of the street,
Patricia felt a queer thrill of excitement and
apprehension as she gazed up at the house
which was to be her home for a whole year.
What joys and sorrows would come to her
there? Could she make good? Would her unknown
benefactor reveal his or her identity
before the year was out? Would she be coming
back here this time next fall? Even now, the
very idea of Anne and Jane returning next
September without her brought a queer lump
into her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just nervous,&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;I must
not think of the future at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determinedly she shook off her apprehensions,
and followed the other girls into the
house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />THE ALLEY GANG</h2>
<p>As Anne opened the door and started down
a long hall, from which rooms opened on either
side, a short, dark little girl, whose round
brown face instantly reminded one of a pleasant
hazel nut, appeared from a room at the very
end of the corridor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anne, darling!&rdquo; she shrieked, dashing
along the passage and throwing herself upon
Anne so violently that Anne staggered and fell
back against Jane, who had to grasp one of the
pillars quickly to save herself from falling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so rough, Fran!&rdquo; gasped Anne,
but as she spoke, Frances transferred her
embraces to the other two girls in turn, while
Patricia stood beside the door watching, until
Anne led her forward and began introductions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This roughneck is Frances Quinne, who
lives at the end of the alley. You see, this
corridor is so long and narrow we call it &lsquo;The
Alley&rsquo; and the eleven girls who live here are
known as The Alley Gang. Kath come yet?&rdquo;
she inquired, as Frances shook hands with
Patricia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s upstairs. You might tell me your
friend&rsquo;s name; that&rsquo;s only common politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your welcome literally knocked me out,&rdquo;
laughed Anne. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Patricia Randall, and
is going to be in our class, and live here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; demanded Frances in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and, what&rsquo;s more, right in the <i>alley</i>!&rdquo;
cried Jane, triumphantly holding up a card
which she had picked out of a pile on the hall
table. While the others were talking, Jane
had been busily rummaging among the cards of
room assignments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; said Anne, taking the bit of
pasteboard from Jane. &ldquo;No. 5. Right, next to
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And across from us,&rdquo; added Jane. &ldquo;Has
Ruth come yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight little girl with big shy black eyes
and a boyish bob ran down the stairs and approached
the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by being up there when
I come?&rdquo; demanded Jane, shaking her room
mate affectionately.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s pale face flushed slightly as she
replied in a soft little voice: &ldquo;I went up to
see if Clarice had all of her things out of No.
14.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No excuse at all,&rdquo; declared Jane. &ldquo;This
is my room mate, Ruth Maynard; Patricia
Randall, a new member of our Gang.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about Clarice, Ruthie?&rdquo; asked Anne
curiously, after Ruth had silently shaken hands
with Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s moving down here to No. 4,&rdquo; replied
Ruth quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night!&rdquo; ejaculated Hazel, sitting
down violently upon one of the trunks which
lined the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, boy! Oh, boy!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down <i>here</i>!&rdquo; repeated Anne. &ldquo;How come?
Don&rsquo;t know whether or not I fancy her for an
opposite neighbor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows why she&rsquo;s been moved,&rdquo;
contributed Frances excitedly. &ldquo;She went to
her old room as a matter of course when she
came this morning, and then we found her card
had No. 4 on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just fierce!&rdquo; cried Hazel.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so noisy and notorious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Hazel,&rdquo; protested Jane, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
nothing really bad about Clarice. She got herself
talked about last year, it is true, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the Powers-that-Be think we&rsquo;ll reform
her,&rdquo; suggested a gentle voice behind the
group.</p>
<p>Everybody turned to face a fair, plump girl
with braids of honey-colored hair wound around
her shapely head, despite the prevailing fashion
of short locks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Taylor!&rdquo; cried Hazel, joyfully kissing
her room mate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, Hail, The Gang&rsquo;s All Here!&rdquo; chanted
a brisk voice, as its owner, a tall, finely developed
girl with red cheeks and brown skin,
which bespoke a love for out-of-doors life,
jumped from the third last step to the hall
below and encircled with her long arms as many
of the girls as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katharine, you hoyden!&rdquo; exclaimed Anne.
&ldquo;Let me present Patricia Randall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This noisy creature is my room mate,&rdquo;
added Hazel, as Katharine gave Patricia a
regular man&rsquo;s grasp of the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the Gang is missing,&rdquo; commented
Anne. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Boy Friend&rsquo; is bringing her down by auto
after dinner,&rdquo; said Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be going to be Patricia&rsquo;s room
mate,&rdquo; offered Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is,&rdquo; announced Jane. &ldquo;I saw her
card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What room did she have last year?&rdquo; whispered
Patricia to Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. 4; but she felt quite abused at not
having a room mate, so I imagine she&rsquo;ll be
delighted to move in with you. Here comes
Dolly,&rdquo; she added in an undertone, as the front
door opened and a medium sized woman of
about twenty-eight entered, followed by a short
rather heavy girl whose restless black eyes
missed no detail of the group before her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, girls,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vincent, smiling
patronizingly upon them, &ldquo;how are you all?
Glad to get back?&rdquo; Without waiting for a reply,
she went on: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find some changes
here this fall. Clarice,&rdquo; laying her hand on
the girl&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;is to be down here with us in
No. 4. We also have a new member of our
household, Miss Patricia Randall,&rdquo; crossing
the hall to shake hands with Patricia. &ldquo;I do
hope you&rsquo;ll like us all, and be happy here.&rdquo;
Then she continued, without stopping for Patricia&rsquo;s
reply, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re to have a new maid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, where is Lizzie?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She got married this summer,&rdquo; replied Mrs.
Vincent; &ldquo;and, my dears, you should have seen
the beautiful presents she received! Our new
maid&rsquo;s name is Rhoda Hurd, and the Dean says
she comes highly recommended. She&rsquo;ll be
here some time tonight. You had better all
unpack now, and get ready for dinner. Arnold
Hall girls will take the southwest end of the
dining room, as usual. Come, Miss Randall,
I&rsquo;ll show you your room. Of course it looks
rather bare now,&rdquo; she added, when they stood
on the threshold, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll soon change all
that. My room is No. 1, right back of the reception
room. If you want anything, don&rsquo;t
hesitate to come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>When Patricia found herself alone, her
glance traveled from the day beds on either
side of the room to the two dressers flanking
the doorway and to the writing tables in the
big bay window. In spite of its bare floor and
curtainless windows, the room had distinct
possibilities; for the furniture was Early
American, and the woodwork was good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she demanded of Anne, who came
in at that moment, &ldquo;do they have that heavy
barred wire outside of the windows? It reminds
me of a prison, or makes me feel as if I
were in a cage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, a sort of a prison,&rdquo; laughed Anne.
&ldquo;You see, some of the girls like to stay out
later than 10:30, and if it were possible to
climb in the windows, nobody knows what time
they would come in. The Black Book wouldn&rsquo;t
be of any use then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia looked puzzled. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Black
Book?&rsquo;&rdquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; beside the telephone booth in the front
hall, near Dolly&rsquo;s room, is a table upon which
rests a big, black blank book. Whenever you go
out or come in after dinner, you must register
in it your name and the hour. The girls take
turns looking after it, and at bed time, Dolly
inspects it before she makes the round of the
rooms. And, by the way, whenever the outside
door at the back of the hall is opened, it rings
a bell in Dolly&rsquo;s room, right under the bed. So
you see how good your chances are of staying
out nights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me something about Clarice,&rdquo; begged
Patricia, sitting down on one of the beds.
&ldquo;Why do all the girls dislike her so very
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t really dislike her,&rdquo; replied
Anne, plumping down beside Patricia. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
lots of fun, and generous to a fault; but she
has such a loud laugh, and doesn&rsquo;t care what
she does or says. A good time appeals to her
a whole lot more than does study, and last
year she played around too much with a boy
upon whom the authorities frowned. The girls
on this floor have always been so congenial,
and have had no demerits for conduct; so
naturally they rather resent the introduction
of Clarice. I think, though, that there is really
a lot of good in the girl, if one could only develop
it. Let&rsquo;s go down the hall and see if
Kath has a dress you could wear to dinner.
Mine would be too large for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just as they stepped out into the hall, the
doorbell rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s Dolly&rsquo;s boy friend,&rdquo; whispered
Anne, pausing to peer around one of the
pillars, and catching sight of the top of a man&rsquo;s
hat showing in the door pane. &ldquo;Wait a
minute, I want you to get a look at him. He&rsquo;s
a special student here, and years younger than
Doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door leading to the cellar opened suddenly,
and a black-gowned maid appeared and
hurried down the hall to answer the bell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Apparently Rhoda has arrived. Isn&rsquo;t she
pretty?&rdquo; breathed Anne softly.</p>
<p>When the door was opened, a low-toned conversation
ensued, of which the eavesdroppers
could hear nothing. Then Rhoda admitted the
blond youth, who stood waiting while the maid
came down the hall toward the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one to see Miss Randall,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>Patricia clutched Anne&rsquo;s arm in a frenzy.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to come with me,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you expecting a bag?&rdquo; inquired the boy
gravely, fixing his great grey eyes upon Patricia
when she reached the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she faltered; &ldquo;I left it on the bus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The driver was going to bring it down on
the six,&rdquo; volunteered Anne irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said the youth, &ldquo;and asked me to
deliver it. I have it in the vestibule.&rdquo; Opening
the door, he secured the bag and handed it
to Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very grateful to you,&rdquo; said Patricia
a bit stiffly. &ldquo;It was good of you to bring it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No trouble at all. I was down at the shelter
waiting for some one&mdash;&rdquo; he broke off suddenly,
as if fearing he had said too much, and
bowed himself solemnly out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Anne. &ldquo;Of all things!
You seem fated to get mixed up with that
young man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? I suppose Mike remembered that
he was on the bus with us, and just naturally
gave the bag to him on that account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. Anyhow, now you won&rsquo;t have
to borrow a dress. You&rsquo;d better hurry, though;
it&rsquo;s after six, and we dine&mdash;mark, I said <i>dine</i>&mdash;at
six-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner was quite an experience for Patricia,
who had never before seen a college dining
room. The big low room was bare and unattractive
in itself, but the long tables, each
surrounded by twenty girls in pretty dinner
gowns, the bright lights, and the orange-clad
waitresses made up for lack of decorations
elsewhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My ears will grow at least a yard long
here,&rdquo; she observed to Anne, who sat next to
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo; inquired
that young lady, reaching for the olives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there are so many interesting conversations
going on all around me, that I want
to hear them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anne laughed. &ldquo;This is nothing; just wait
until classes are in full swing. Then child
psychology, music theory, library cataloguing,
art appreciation, domestic science, and half a
dozen other subjects are all being discussed
simultaneously.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>That evening most of the girls had unpacking
and settling to finish, but a few members of
the Alley Gang gathered in Anne&rsquo;s attractive
room to visit. Betty Grant had just arrived,
and she and Patricia had approved of each
other at the first glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, Betty,&rdquo; Anne was saying, &ldquo;is the
Boy Friend coming down week ends, as he
did last year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; this year, I&rsquo;m going to work&mdash;<i>hard</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am. I told Ed he could come only
twice during this term&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a few times in between,&rdquo; finished
Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; began Betty, in a different
tone. &ldquo;I saw the queerest thing, just as Ed
and I drove up. There was a fellow standing
in front of the laundry window, right under
your room, Hazel, evidently talking to some
one inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Betty,&rdquo; protested Katharine,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re making that up to change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest to goodness, I&rsquo;m not! I saw him
plain as daylight. I didn&rsquo;t say anything to
Ed, because he would have wanted to investigate,
and I&rsquo;ve no fancy for having him get into
an argument with strange men. He might have
had a gun, for all I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, Betty! We&rsquo;ll all be afraid to go
to sleep tonight,&rdquo; shuddered Mary. &ldquo;Hazel,
you&rsquo;ll have to push your bed up close to mine
so you can protect me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did the man look like?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t see his face, but he was slight,
of medium height and wore a grey suit and
hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blond youth!&rdquo; whispered Anne to Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would he be doing prowling
around here?&rdquo; asked Patricia, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me! Oh, hello, Lu, where have you
been all the evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the laundry part of the time. I came
on here right from a house party, and my
clothes are in a fine state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane, Anne, Hazel, and Patricia glanced
significantly at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you were pressing, Lu?&rdquo; asked Hazel
mischievously.</p>
<p>Before Lucile had a chance to reply, Betty
leaned forward and inquired, &ldquo;Did <i>you</i> see
the man, Lu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who was looking in the laundry
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucile laughed, a bit loudly for her. &ldquo;Nobody
around the place while I was there,&rdquo; she replied,
with marked carelessness, &ldquo;only Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was <i>she</i> doing?&rdquo; asked Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pressing her uniforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A discussion of the new maid and her predecessor
followed, and the subject of the mysterious
man was dropped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />MOSS</h2>
<p>One morning a couple of weeks later, Patricia
was wakened suddenly by a marshmallow
landing on her nose and scattering its fine,
powdered sugar all over her face. Sitting up
quickly, she saw through her open door Ruth
and Jane in their room across the hall, sitting
on their beds, doubled up with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fiends!&rdquo; she cried softly. &ldquo;Just you
wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Betty
sleepily, from the other bed, without even
opening her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Goths across the hall threw a marshmallow
in my face!&rdquo; replied Patricia, seizing
the unfortunate bit of confectionery and returning
it with such good aim that it struck
Jane&rsquo;s hand and bounded off onto the rug,
where it deposited the rest of its sugar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Lazy Bones!&rdquo; ordered Jane.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to go out for moss before breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot all about it,&rdquo; groaned Patricia. &ldquo;I
wish that botany class was in Hades.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d all shut up,&rdquo; complained
Betty. &ldquo;I want to sleep; and, thank Heaven,
I don&rsquo;t take botany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia was soon ready, and the three girls
stole softly down the hall and tried the front
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; called Mrs. Vincent, who
slept, not only with her door open, but also,
so the girls said, with her eyes and ears wide
as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patricia, Ruth, and Jane going out for moss
for botany class,&rdquo; answered Jane. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
back before breakfast time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she think we can find moss on the
fire escape?&rdquo; demanded Jane scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where <i>are</i> we going?&rdquo; asked Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll cut through the back yard here
into Foth Road and head out toward the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went around the side of the dormitory,
and, to their surprise, saw Rhoda coming toward
them across the back yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you up pretty early, Rhoda?&rdquo; asked
Jane casually, as the girl flushed and looked
embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so very,&rdquo; was the low reply. &ldquo;I often
run out here for a breath of fresh air before
starting my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How fussed she acted,&rdquo; commented Ruth,
&ldquo;just as if she&rsquo;d been caught doing something
she didn&rsquo;t want anybody to know about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I noticed that too,&rdquo; said Patricia,
carefully following her companions down the
treacherous, broken stone ledges into the yard
behind Arnold Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Ruth,&rdquo; cried Jane, &ldquo;&lsquo;Big House&rsquo; is
occupied! I didn&rsquo;t know that; did you?&rdquo; The
girl regarded in surprise the three-story brick
house across a narrow stretch of green lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;adding softly, &ldquo;Come on;
somebody is watching us from that bay window
on the second floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; demanded Jane,
hurrying after her room mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a woman&rsquo;s hand pull the curtain aside
a little while we were waiting for Pat to come
down the steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame to spoil our short cut to Foth
Road; for I suppose we can&rsquo;t go through there
any more. That house was empty all last
year,&rdquo; explained Jane, turning to Patricia,
&ldquo;which made it rather nice for us because, besides
using the yard as a thoroughfare, we
sometimes had little parties there or met our
boy friends when we didn&rsquo;t want to go out the
front way with them. Oh, I assure you it was
useful in lots of ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were out on the road by then, and walking
briskly toward the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never find any moss if we keep to the
road,&rdquo; objected Ruth, after they had walked
a mile in vain. &ldquo;I should think we&rsquo;d have to
go into the woods, see, over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too afraid of
snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia laughed. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any snakes
in a pine woods. They&rsquo;re mostly where there
are lots of rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway we&rsquo;ll go a little farther and
then I, for one, take to the woods,&rdquo; decided
Ruth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find some moss soon,
and go home; and I won&rsquo;t face Yates again
with no specimens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the old pill, though?&rdquo; said Jane to
Patricia. &ldquo;Did you ever see anybody so cold
and stone-like? Even when he says unpleasant
things&mdash;and, oh, boy! can&rsquo;t he be disagreeable
when he likes!&mdash;his face never changes from
that set, gloomy expression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is most peculiar,&rdquo; agreed Patricia,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t like him even <i>any</i>! For that
matter, no love at all is lost between us; something
in the way he looks at me tells me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here we are!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane, pointing
to an old shed a few feet from the road. On
its roof, near the ridge pole, was a luxuriant
growth of bright green moss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we get at it?&rdquo; asked Ruth, as they
scrambled across a wire fence and crossed a
stretch of rough, coarse grass. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good
at climbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;How about you, Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I could get up far enough to reach
it, if you girls will boost a bit,&rdquo; replied Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s O. K. with us, but for Heaven&rsquo;s sake be
as quiet as possible. We don&rsquo;t want the dog
set on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nobody&rsquo;s around so early as this;
there&rsquo;s no window on this side of the shed,
and the door is on the other. The farm house
is back of that clump of trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy telling you don&rsquo;t know anything about
the country,&rdquo; said Jane scornfully; &ldquo;these
farmers get up early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping up on a log, which happened to lie
conveniently close to the building, Patricia,
with the aid of the girls, got a firm grip on
the edge of the roof and drew herself up to a
point where she could lie flat on its weather-worn
boards and stretch her long arms up toward
the coveted plants. With much effort,
she succeeded in reaching the moss and in tearing
up two big handfuls. Resting on her elbows
for a moment to ease the strain on her
arms, she was horrified to feel the boards underneath
them begin to sag; and, with a dull
splintering of ancient wood, her hands and
lower arms disappeared into a yawning cavity.
Simultaneously, the moss dropped from her
fingers into the depths below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>A snort, a gasp, and a forceful exclamation
from within the shed mingled with Patricia&rsquo;s
startled cry of &ldquo;Girls, I&rsquo;m falling in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do? What shall we do?&rdquo;
demanded Ruth excitedly as Patricia, speechless
with horror, gazed down through the hole
over which she hung, and met the cold, grey
eyes of Professor Yates! His immaculate
shoulders and smooth black hair were covered
with bits of moss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull me down, quick!&rdquo; cried the horrified
Patricia, finally recovering the power of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will spoil your dress,&rdquo; warned Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! Get me down, for Pete&rsquo;s
sake!&rdquo; retorted Patricia wildly.</p>
<p>With their united efforts, the two girls succeeded
in dragging Patricia safely to the
ground, minus the moss, and with several long
scratches on her arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the moss?&rdquo; demanded Ruth in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All over Professor Yates!&rdquo; gasped Patricia,
hysterically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Ruth, while Jane looked as
if she feared Patricia had lost her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in that shed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo; retorted Jane, feeling her
pulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest to goodness! Cross my heart!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>At that moment, the object of their discussion
strolled around the corner of the shed. He
had brushed himself off, and now looked as
calm and neat as if he were in his classroom.
His gaze traveled coldly from one to another,
then, looking directly at Patricia, he drawled:
&ldquo;To what am I indebted for this most unconventional
call?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your demand for specimens of moss today
&lsquo;without fail,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted Jane glibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most novel situation, stealing it from my
own roof, and ruining the roof in the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had no idea it was your roof,&rdquo; retorted
Patricia hotly, &ldquo;and I had no intention of
breaking through it. It was anything but a
pleasant experience, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we expect to assume any expense
involved,&rdquo; put in Jane soothingly, as they
turned to go.</p>
<p>Professor Yates made no reply, but stood
watching them scramble over the fence and
start down the road toward college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that just terrible?&rdquo; gasped Patricia
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m certainly done for with him now.
Next time I do any climbing for specimens,
you&rsquo;ll know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever do you suppose he was doing out
there?&rdquo; demanded Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard him say it was his roof, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; retorted Jane. &ldquo;Clarice said once that
he had an old place where he raises all kinds
of truck for the lab, but I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention
to her. She talks so much that half the
time I don&rsquo;t listen very attentively; and I
haven&rsquo;t given it a thought since.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait until the girls hear about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a spread tonight; did
you know it?&rdquo; asked Jane. &ldquo;Doll&rsquo;s going out
with one of her boy friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dark youth who&rsquo;s a &lsquo;special&rsquo; in some
year or other?&rdquo; asked Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have to keep better tabs on him,&rdquo;
commented Ruth; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a born flirt. I was at
the Black Book the other night when he came
in, and he tried to make a date with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he succeed?&rdquo; asked Jane mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did <i>not</i>! I can&rsquo;t bear him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you realize, girls,&rdquo; inquired Ruth, &ldquo;that
we are still moss-less?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;ll continue to be, so far as I
am concerned,&rdquo; retorted Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, somebody in the lab will be sure to have
some,&rdquo; said Jane easily, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll just borrow
a little of it. I don&rsquo;t feel equal to hunting any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The spread was about to get under way at
eight-thirty that evening. Mrs. Vincent and
her youthful escort, Ivan Zahn, had departed
for a concert which the college was giving to
entertain the Freshman Class. Rhoda was
looking after the Black Book and the telephone;
so the girls were quite free to enjoy themselves,
without responsibility. The new maid
had quickly become as much of a favorite as
her predecessor; for she was accommodating
and good-tempered, and the inhabitants of
Arnold Hall, especially those on the first floor,
treated her almost as one of themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did anybody telephone the Varsity Coffee
Shoppe for the eats?&rdquo; demanded Hazel, coming
out into the hall in a suit of bright red lounging
pajamas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Jane from her room, where
she was putting frantic last minute lines on
a poster which was due the next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who took the order?&rdquo; asked Frances, rushing
in to borrow some thread to run up a rip
in her coolie coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al, and he said he&rsquo;d send them right down,&rdquo;
contributed Ruth from her bed, where she lay
on her back trying to fix an important bit of
psychology in her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut the study!&rdquo; ordered Anne, entering
with Lucile, Betty, and Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to get this tonight,&rdquo; cried Ruth, hanging
onto the book which Anne tried to take
out of her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t; get up early in the morning
and do it. Then it will be all the fresher
in your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you like early rising,&rdquo; laughed Betty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>Anne continued to pull, and finally got Ruth
off the bed. Katharine, who came in at that
moment, attracted by the noise, slipped past
Ruth and Anne, flopped into the recently
vacated bed, and pulled up the covers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all things!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth indignantly,
jerking away from Anne. &ldquo;Get out of my bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Katharine extended a long, strong arm and
pulled Betty in beside her, while Frances piled
in on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safety in numbers,&rdquo; laughed Katharine
impishly. &ldquo;Get us out if you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll help you, Ruth!&rdquo; shouted Clarice, dashing
in with a glass of water which she sprinkled
freely on the three girls in the bed. With a cry
of protest they sprang up and chased Clarice
the length of the hall where she barricaded
herself with a heavy chair in the corner beside
the telephone booth. At the other end of the
hall, on a couple of well-stuffed white laundry
bags which were ready for the collector in the
morning, perched Hazel, swinging her red-clad
legs and singing: &ldquo;I want a drink! Kathy
wants a drink! Francy wants a drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Al, girls!&rdquo; called Clarice from her
vantage point, where she could see out onto
the street.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>The feud was forgotten, as they all trooped
forward to relieve Rhoda of the basket which
the boy had brought. Sitting down on the
runner which extended the length of the hall,
the girls quickly disposed of orangeade, sandwiches,
cakes, and ice cream, not forgetting to
give Rhoda a share. A songfest followed, and
a general romp the length of the alley was in
full swing when the front door opened suddenly
and Mrs. Vincent walked in, alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls!&rdquo; she cried sharply. &ldquo;Stop that noise
at once! You sound like a lot of hyenas! I
could hear you up to the corner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brought her home so early?&rdquo; muttered
Betty to Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have had a scrap with Ivan,&rdquo; whispered
Anne. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the telephone rang, and Mrs. Vincent
paused to gaze hopefully at Rhoda who
answered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Rhoda, in a low tone. &ldquo;Yes,
I&rsquo;ll call her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an oddly excited expression on her
usually calm face, Rhoda turned to Mrs. Vincent,
saying, &ldquo;Someone wants to speak with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />A MEDDLER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Mrs. Vincent talking. What?
I&rsquo;m very sorry. The girls were having a little
party, and didn&rsquo;t realize, I&rsquo;m afraid, how much
noise they were making. What did you say,
please? Oh, we&mdash;ll, I&rsquo;ll see what they think
about it. Of course, you realize that they are
not children to be ordered about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t think so a minute ago,&rdquo; giggled
Anne under her breath to Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Vincent hung up the receiver and turned
to face the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a nice fix now!&rdquo; she snapped.
&ldquo;Mrs. Brock, who lives back of us, has been
greatly disturbed by the noise you have been
making all the evening, and feels that an
apology is due her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What utter nonsense!&rdquo; cried Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be cuckoo!&rdquo; exclaimed Clarice
hotly.</p>
<p>The rest of the girls stood looking at one
another in astonishment, while Rhoda turned
her back quickly and bent her head low over
the open Black Book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you going to do about it?&rdquo;
continued Mrs. Vincent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just nothing at all,&rdquo; replied Jane; &ldquo;her
demand is absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is unreasonable; but the
trouble is,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Vincent, flushing,
&ldquo;she says unless a couple of you go over and
present an apology for the crowd, she will lodge
a complaint at the office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I <i>know</i> she is crazy,&rdquo; snapped Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Vincent, &ldquo;a question
of my incompetence, or of my inability to
manage you properly, will arise if such a complaint
is lodged. Of course, you must do as
you wish. I&rsquo;m simply laying the whole matter
frankly before you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Vincent turned abruptly and disappeared
into her own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a pretty mess!&rdquo; scolded Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly your fault!&rdquo; cried Hazel, looking
angrily at Clarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it, I&rsquo;d like to know!&rdquo; demanded the
girl, flushing a dull red, but gazing defiantly
at her accuser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did most of the yelling and rough-housing,&rdquo;
retorted Frances promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t pile into Ruth&rsquo;s bed; I didn&rsquo;t sit
beside the back door, singing; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; interrupted Jane soothingly, &ldquo;I think
we all did our share; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of trying to place the blame
now?&rdquo; asked Patricia suddenly. &ldquo;The question
is how to fix things up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t let Dolly down, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Mary slowly. &ldquo;She <i>is</i> incompetent, and awfully
silly at times; but, after all, she is our chaperon
and we owe loyalty to her. She might lose
her position as the result of the complaint,
and we&rsquo;d hate to be party to taking a job from
anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you all feel that I&rsquo;m mostly to
blame,&rdquo; broke in Clarice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go over to Big
House and apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost before she had time to think, Patricia
heard herself saying: &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a couple of good sports!&rdquo; cried Jane
heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it too late to go now?&rdquo; asked Patricia,
looking at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly ten. Better ask Dolly,&rdquo; advised
Anne.</p>
<p>Patricia went to the chaperon&rsquo;s door,
knocked, and when Mrs. Vincent opened it,
stated quietly: &ldquo;Clarice and I are going over
to apologize to Mrs. Brock. Shall we go now,
or wait until morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t matter, I suppose; whichever
time you prefer,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Vincent
slowly, looking past Patricia to Clarice, who
stood leaning against the Black Book table. The
girl&rsquo;s black eyes met hers, and a long, meaning
look passed between them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go now, then, and get it over with,&rdquo;
decided Patricia. &ldquo;Come on, Clarice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two went out of the front door and the
rest of the girls gathered in Jane&rsquo;s room to
await results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a day!&rdquo; sighed Ruth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never
get up so early again. It brings bad luck.
What with the moss adventure this morning,
and now this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Professor Yates act in class?&rdquo;
asked Hazel, as the rest smiled over the story
of the moss, which they had heard earlier in
the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as usual, except perhaps a little more
sarcastic,&rdquo; began Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more generous with puzzling questions,
especially to Pats,&rdquo; broke in Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny they can&rsquo;t get along together,&rdquo;
mused Mary. &ldquo;Pat is such a peach of a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no rhyme or reason in anything
Yates does,&rdquo; declared Hazel bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat <i>is</i> a peach,&rdquo; agreed Anne fervently,
&ldquo;and I think we&rsquo;re mighty lucky to get her in
our Gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us!&rdquo; chanted Frances
softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems awfully queer to me, though,&rdquo; put
in Lucile, &ldquo;for a girl to leave a college voluntarily
after a year there, and come away up
here where she knows no one, to finish her
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her aunt and cousin are here,&rdquo; spoke up
Anne, loyally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t see them making much fuss over
her!&rdquo; retorted Lucile. &ldquo;Ted&rsquo;s been here only
two or three times to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted is a very busy boy.&rdquo; Anne spoke up
promptly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Forestry, and that takes
him out a lot this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to think of it,&rdquo; commented Ruth, &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t seen him much at the Frat House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should know what goes on there,&rdquo;
laughed Katharine, teasingly. &ldquo;Such luck as
you and Jane have&mdash;a room right next to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice&rsquo;s room is even better&mdash;or worse,&rdquo;
said Jane; &ldquo;for hers is opposite the men&rsquo;s
living room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why worse?&rdquo; demanded Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll change rooms with you some night, and
let you listen to their blamed radio until the
wee small hours, and then again early in the
morning, before anybody is up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Clarice,&rdquo; broke in Lucile, &ldquo;I
think there&rsquo;s something between her and
Dolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Betty quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some secret, or understanding, or favoritism,
or something,&rdquo; replied Lucile. &ldquo;Did
none of you see the look they exchanged when
Pats told Dolly they&rsquo;d go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered Anne thoughtfully; &ldquo;it
all but talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some reason why Clarice was
moved down here this year, and I&rsquo;ll bet Dolly
was at the root of it,&rdquo; declared Lucile, emphasizing
her words by pounding on the foot of
the bed beside which she sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Lu,&rdquo; broke in Hazel shyly,
&ldquo;how&rsquo;s your blond friend? Seen him lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>My</i> blond friend is good!&rdquo; jeered Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he? Who is he?&rdquo; demanded Mary
and Betty in unison. &ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t we ever
seen him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darlings,&rdquo; said Lucile mockingly, &ldquo;just
because on the day we came back, a good-looking,
yellow-haired youth stopped me at the
top of the hill to ask where Arnold Hall was,
these silly girls imagined I had a date with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should a fellow want Arnold Hall?&rdquo;
demanded Katharine in surprised tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he has a sweetie here,&rdquo; proposed
Hazel mischievously, looking at Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea,&rdquo; replied Lucile, flatly
ignoring Hazel&rsquo;s insinuations; &ldquo;maybe it&rsquo;s&mdash;Patricia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; contradicted Anne; &ldquo;she never
saw him before the day we came down.&rdquo; Too
late she realized what she had admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Came down! Oh, then he was on <i>your</i>
train. Ah, ha! Now we&rsquo;re getting at something!&rdquo;
exulted Lucile.</p>
<p>Poor Anne&rsquo;s fair complexion changed to a
bright pink, as she struggled to make her words
sound casual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sat across from us, and we happened
to notice him because he was so good-looking.
We haven&rsquo;t seen him for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; spoke up Jane; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;d never
guess where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell us,&rdquo; said Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night, I was coming from the library,
and because it was rather late, I took a chance
on cutting through the yard back of here. As
I got to the step up into this yard, I heard the
sound of a typewriter in Big House. It surprised
me; for I understand Mrs. Brock is
quite elderly. I glanced carelessly up at the
lighted windows, and there in a second floor
room facing this way, sat our unknown blond
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s her son,&rdquo; proposed Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son, nothing! Grandson more likely,&rdquo; contradicted
Hazel. &ldquo;Maybe the girls will meet
him. Why didn&rsquo;t more of us go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane laughed. &ldquo;You all had a chance, but
you didn&rsquo;t make the most of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p class="tb">At this moment the front door opened
quietly, closed again, footsteps were heard
coming along the hall, and Patricia and Clarice
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us just everything,&rdquo; ordered Anne,
making places on Jane&rsquo;s bed for the newcomers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Patricia slowly, &ldquo;a maid led
us into the living room, which is that room in
front where the big bay window is; and there,
before the fire, sat a tiny, white-haired old lady
with the keenest brown eyes I have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They bored right through one,&rdquo; contributed
Clarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never said a word to us, only looked
up, and then tried to quiet her white Spitz
which began to bark his head off at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she&rsquo;d be used to noise, if she
has one of those,&rdquo; observed Hazel; &ldquo;they sho&rsquo;
do bark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Mrs. Vincent slipped into the room,
and, sitting down beside Clarice, slid an arm
around her, while the girls exchanged significant
glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Mrs. Brock got the dog quieted
down,&rdquo; continued Patricia, &ldquo;I said that we
had come to represent the girls on our floor,
and apologize for the excessive noise tonight;
that we had not intended to annoy anyone, and
had not even thought of it as a possibility; we
were only having a little party among ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Drinking party, I suppose!&rsquo; she snapped,
looking us over from head to foot, for she
hadn&rsquo;t asked us to sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet she knows how many buttons are
on my blouse, and even where one buttonhole is
torn,&rdquo; observed Clarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We had only orangeade,&rsquo; I replied, as
good-naturedly as I could; for it certainly was
annoying to be addressed in the tones she
used,&rdquo; went on Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you sure of that?&rsquo; she demanded, fixing
her brown eyes on me, like crabs. &lsquo;I distinctly
heard some one singing a song about
wanting a drink.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A burst of laughter from the girls interrupted
Patricia&rsquo;s story, while Jane ruffled Hazel&rsquo;s
curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>I</i> took a hand,&rdquo; announced Clarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You did,&rsquo; I told her, &lsquo;and we had several;
but they were all made of oranges, just as Patricia
has told you. We may be noisy, but we&rsquo;re
not liars!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; asked Jane eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; she just glared at me, and turned
back to Pat,&rdquo; replied Clarice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aside from the personal annoyance,&rsquo; she
went on,&rdquo; continued Patricia, &ldquo;&lsquo;I consider it
highly detrimental to the reputation of college
women to have such yelling and noise emanating
from a supposedly respectable dormitory.&rsquo;
Before we could answer, fortunately, perhaps,
for I didn&rsquo;t know what to say next,&rdquo; went on
Patricia, &ldquo;she pressed a bell near her chair,
and almost immediately we heard footsteps on
the stairs, the heavy portieres between the
living room and the hall were pushed aside,
and there stood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The good-looking young blond!&rdquo; finished
Hazel, excitedly clasping and unclasping her
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how did you know?&rdquo; demanded Patricia
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him over there in the window last
night, and the girls were just saying that perhaps
you would meet him,&rdquo; replied Jane. &ldquo;But
please go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Norman Young, my secretary,&rsquo; said the
old lady, looking inquiringly at us. Clarice supplied
our names, and the youth bowed gravely.
&lsquo;Norman,&rsquo; she asked, &lsquo;did you type the letter
I dictated earlier this evening?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not yet, Mrs. Brock,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You need not write it. That&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; she
added curtly, as the young man lingered a moment,
eyeing Clarice. As soon as he had disappeared,
she turned to us again. &lsquo;You may
go too,&rsquo; she announced abruptly; &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t
let me hear such a rumpus over there again.&rsquo;
Then Clarice spoke up. &lsquo;Mrs. Brock, we told
you we were sorry, and we are; but we can&rsquo;t
promise never to make another sound, when
we have parties, or at any other time. There
are forty-five girls in the house, and it&rsquo;s unreasonable
to expect us to be as quiet as deaf-mutes.&rsquo;
Before she could get her breath to
annihilate Clarice, which I thought she would
do, I broke in and said that perhaps she&rsquo;d like
us and understand college life better if she
came over to Arnold Hall some time and got
acquainted with the girls and see how we live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Maybe I should,&rsquo; she replied slowly, and
really her face changed so that I thought she
was going to smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you have <i>done</i> it, Pats,&rdquo; groaned
Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever possessed you to say that?&rdquo; complained
Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in creation <i>is</i> she, that she thinks she
can take such a hand in our affairs?&rdquo; demanded
Katharine hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I felt sorry for her,&rdquo; contended Patricia
stoutly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s old, and all alone in that
big house&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Pats, not alone; think of that attractive
youth,&rdquo; protested Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think she&rsquo;s longing for human contacts,&rdquo;
continued Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to be,&rdquo; remarked Lucile sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why she is annoyed by our fun,
kind of an outsider envying those who are on
the inside; like a kid who&rsquo;s not invited to a
party, and so wants to break it up,&rdquo; concluded
Patricia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sentimental Pat!&rdquo; scoffed Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you are all annoyed about it,&rdquo;
said Patricia, flushing, &ldquo;but I suddenly felt so
sorry for her that I spoke before I thought.
I never dreamed you&rsquo;d object to her. Probably
she won&rsquo;t come, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Jane emphatically, &ldquo;that
you handled the matter in the best possible
way. What would we gain by fighting with her?
Putting aside of any question of kindness, it&rsquo;s
much wiser for us to be friendly with her, if
she will let us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vincent,
speaking for the first time, and getting
up to go back to her own room. &ldquo;Now get to
bed as quickly as possible,&rdquo; she added, as the
clock struck eleven.</p>
<p>There were three people in the college colony
who were wakeful that night: Patricia tossed
from side to side, as she kept going over in
her mind the inexorable circumstances which
continued to involve her in strange situations
with Norman Young. Directly above her, on
the third floor, Rhoda the maid was shedding
tears as she worried over the affairs of one
near and dear to her. In his room across the
two back yards, Norman Young alternately
pondered over Clarice&rsquo;s pretty face and the
solving of a problem which involved some cleverness
on his part.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />A FALL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to the Greystone game?&rdquo;
asked Hazel, as part of the Alley Gang was
walking back to the Hall after lunch one crisp
sunny day in October.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ted?&rdquo; queried Patricia, curiously.</p>
<p>Anne nodded, adding with a broad grin,
&ldquo;Katharine and Professor Boyd are going
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oliver Boyd was a young instructor, who had
been engaged for the History Department that
fall, a slim, attractive youth, whose big brown
eyes looked shyly out from behind octagon
glasses, and whose dark skin made the girls,
when they wanted to tease Katharine, say he
must have Indian blood in his veins. A melodious
voice with a southern accent completed
an ensemble that had proved most intriguing
to the women of Granard. All the girls smiled
upon him, and the registration in History V
was unusually heavy that term. That he was
girl-shy had been the consensus of opinion
until one day Katharine happened to run
across him in the Varsity Book Shoppe; and
a discussion, begun from the talkative Katharine
over the respective merits of note book
covers No. 1 and No. 3, had been the beginning
of the most talked-of of college romances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now just wouldn&rsquo;t a retiring daisy like
Professor Boyd pick a roughneck like Katharine?&rdquo;
commented Lucile disgustedly. &ldquo;I
should think she&rsquo;d scare him to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just jealous!&rdquo; retorted Hazel, quick
to come to the support of her room mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; contradicted Lucile
promptly; &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t deny that they&rsquo;re no
more suited to each other than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but opposites attract,&rdquo; interrupted
Betty; &ldquo;remember your psychology, or was it
physics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else is going to the game?&rdquo; inquired
Jane, returning to the original topic of conversation
in an attempt to check the friction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francie and I are driving down,&rdquo; replied
Patricia, smiling down at the round-faced little
girl beside her. For several weeks now, Patricia
had been the proud possessor of the car
which her father had bought for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Boy Friend?&rdquo; asked Hazel
curiously, turning to look at Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the outs,&rdquo; was the quick reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How come?&rdquo; inquired Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe said he wished Tut Miller would
get a chance to play in the Greystone game&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh!&rdquo; protested her companions in
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s just the way I felt,&rdquo; asserted
Frances; &ldquo;so we promptly had a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; protested Jane, &ldquo;should he
want Jack Dunn to be taken out of the lineup.
He&rsquo;s a far better player than Tut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but I figured it out this way: Joe
and Tut were at Huron Prep together, and
Joe&rsquo;s got an awful case on Tut. When football
practice started, Tut went over big until Jack
began to show what he was made of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And naturally Joe sizzled when Jack got
on the regulars and Tut was his sub,&rdquo; finished
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s the better of the two, of course,&rdquo;
agreed Anne; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t fall for him the
way the rest of you do. He seems to me to be
rather too sure of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has a better right?&rdquo; asked Lucile
sharply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been the absolute idol of this
college and town ever since he made the team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before this challenge could be taken up,
there was a sound of running footsteps behind
them, and Clarice violently pushed in between
Jane and Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; she cried, noisily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; retorted Lucile crisply.
&ldquo;We leave that for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the excitement, Clarice?&rdquo; inquired
Jane quickly, trying to cover Lucile&rsquo;s unkind
thrust at Clarice&rsquo;s poor scholarship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never guess with whom I am going
to the Greystone game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell us quickly,&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;before
we all die of suspense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norman Young! He asked me in Physics
Lab this morning, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physics Lab,&rdquo; repeated Betty in puzzled
tones. &ldquo;How did he happen to be there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know that he registered late,
and is a special student here!&rdquo; asked Jane in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been all this term?&rdquo; demanded
Hazel in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Betty is more interested in certain people
from home than she is in Granard students,&rdquo;
explained Lucile in significant tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not!&rdquo; contradicted Betty promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother; she&rsquo;s only trying to tease
you,&rdquo; said Jane soothingly, flinging an arm
across Betty&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;If I had a devoted
boy friend who wrote me letters every other
day, and came down to spend week ends here,
I shouldn&rsquo;t know all the college gossip either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Anne was whispering to Patricia:
&ldquo;Wonder how Lucile likes Clarice&rsquo;s walking
off with Norman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Pat. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that she
considered him her special property. She&rsquo;s
been going around with Tut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that she does, only I feel it
in my bones, someway, that the meeting at &lsquo;Hill
Top&rsquo; on the day we arrived was not all chance.
I <i>do</i> know that she pricks up her ears whenever
he is mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the library, and Pat reluctantly
left her companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m due here, kids,&rdquo; she called from the
third step, as Jane demanded why she was deserting
them. &ldquo;Something I&rsquo;ve got to look up.
See you later.&rdquo; Waving her hand gaily, she ran
up the long flight of steps and entered the old
grey building.</p>
<p>Some of the rooms were used for graduate
work, or small classes of men students; and
Patricia could hear Professor Donnell&rsquo;s voice
quite distinctly as she passed down the corridor
to the reference department. Three-quarters
of an hour later, having secured the
necessary information, she was just approaching
the outside doorway when Professor Donnell&rsquo;s
class came out of its room, right behind
her. Patricia was rather shy with strangers,
and hurried a bit to keep well ahead of the
men going down the steps. In her haste, she
failed to notice, on a step part way down the
flight, some matted, damp leaves. Her heel
slipped on one of them, and she rolled to the
bottom of the flight. Eighteen men promptly
sprang to her assistance, but the long legs of
a thin dark boy brought him first upon the
scene.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; he asked, raising Patricia
to her feet.</p>
<p>Patricia looked up into solicitous blue eyes,
bent anxiously upon her, and shakily replied
that she didn&rsquo;t think so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a nasty fall,&rdquo; continued the boy,
still carefully holding her by the arm as if he
feared she might collapse any minute.</p>
<p>The other men had gathered about her in a
semi-circle, and Patricia&rsquo;s color came back
with a rush, and flushed her face to a scarlet
which matched the little hat which had fallen
off during her descent and which one of the
men now presented to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucile would say, if she could see me now,
that I fell purposely,&rdquo; thought Patricia, adjusting
the gay little hat with shaking fingers.
Then an awful thought occurred to her. Maybe
these men thought the same thing! People resorted
to all kinds of tricks to meet celebrities,
and Jack Dunn&rsquo;s acquaintanceship was much
sought after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I happened to fall,&rdquo; she
said, trying to laugh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not usually so
careless.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There were some wet leaves on one of the
steps,&rdquo; explained her rescuer, bending his head
protectively over her.</p>
<p>It was a fine shaped head, topped by wavy
brown hair flung back from a broad, very white
forehead. The hands on her arm were shapely,
and the fingers long and slender. A thoroughbred,
thought Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll tell me where you were going,&rdquo;
he continued, motioning his companions peremptorily
away, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk along with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to trouble you further,&rdquo;
protested Patricia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re shaking like a leaf,&rdquo; contradicted
her escort gently, falling into step beside her,
as they started across the campus. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s sit
down over there a while,&rdquo; he added, as they
approached a stone bench under a tree near the
Fine Arts Building; &ldquo;or have you a class
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not until three-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What year are you?&rdquo; he began, as soon as
they were seated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever seen
you before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Sophomore, and my name, by the
way, is Patricia Randall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is Jack Dunn,&rdquo; said the boy, as
simply as if his name were not known the
length and breadth of the campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are not very observing,&rdquo;
remarked Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because we are in the same Shakespeare
class, and have been all this term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;re seated alphabetically. I&rsquo;m
down in the front of the room, and you must
be in the back. So that lets me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three-thirty arrived long before they finished
exchanging personal bits of information,
and Jack left Patricia at the door of her classroom
with a promise to see her again very soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did you get hold of him?&rdquo;
whispered Jane excitedly, as Patricia took her
seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you later,&rdquo; promised Patricia, as Professor
Yates glanced in their direction.</p>
<p>After the class was over, the girls managed
to get away from the rest of the crowd; so, as
they walked slowly across the campus, Patricia
told the story of the fall and its consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lucky girl!&rdquo; sighed Jane, as she
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To have broken no bones?&rdquo; inquired Patricia
innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, just that,&rdquo; replied her companion,
with exaggerated emphasis. &ldquo;Broken hearts
not taken into account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the girls will razz the life out
of me,&rdquo; commented Patricia, after a short
pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell them anything about it, then. I
shan&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But suppose some of them saw us together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. If they don&rsquo;t know how
you met him, it will give them something to
think about.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">That evening Patricia was keenly aware of
curious eyes fixed upon her as she stood in
front of Arnold Hall talking to Jack Dunn.
He had stepped up to her just as she was following
Jane and Anne to the post office after
dinner. The girls obligingly hurried on and
left the two together, but Patricia&rsquo;s cheeks were
red with the knowledge that they were talking
about her as they went back to the dorm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if you&rsquo;d go to see Arliss
with me,&rdquo; began Jack. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s on at the Plaza,
and we&rsquo;d be just in time for the early performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see it,&rdquo; replied Patricia
slowly; &ldquo;but&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll go. I&rsquo;m pretty sure
Jane will sign the Black Book for me if I don&rsquo;t
go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Black Book?&rdquo; repeated Jack in puzzled
tones.</p>
<p>As they started downtown, Patricia told him
all about the Arnold Hall customs and rules,
and answered his questions regarding the
identity of several of the Alley Gang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know many of
the girls here; for I came only this year, transferred
from Floynton University&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I from Brentwood,&rdquo; interrupted Patricia.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that funny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be friends, then, both strangers
in a strange land. Shall we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the movie, they strolled slowly
back to College Hill, chatting as if they had
known each other always.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come in?&rdquo; asked Patricia, as they
reached Arnold Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to, but you see I&rsquo;m in training and
not supposed to be out too late; besides I have
some boning to do yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see when you ever get any studying
done; you&rsquo;re in classes all morning as well as
part of the afternoon, and on the athletic field
until dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t leave me much time, and I&rsquo;ve
just got to make good here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean in order to keep on the team?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; but there&rsquo;s another reason too.
You see, my dad isn&rsquo;t well enough off to send
me to Granard himself; and, well, when you&rsquo;re
indebted to somebody else for a big chance,
why, you&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to make good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know just how that is; for I&rsquo;m in the
same position myself,&rdquo; replied Patricia impulsively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are?&rdquo; questioned Jack. &ldquo;Then you
would understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said a smooth, low voice
behind them, and they turned to face Norman
Young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; replied Jack briefly, while
Patricia murmured a response to the newcomer&rsquo;s
greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice in?&rdquo; queried Norman as he turned
and went up the walk toward the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that fellow,&rdquo; observed Jack, as
the door closed upon Young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t? Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer acting guy. Never caught him in
anything; in fact I don&rsquo;t know him very well,
but I don&rsquo;t trust him. Comes out and sits on
the side lines to watch practice quite often,
and he gives me the jitters. You know him
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I was introduced to him at
Mrs. Brock&rsquo;s house. He&rsquo;s her secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Mrs. Brock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Briefly Patricia told him of their contact
with the eccentric inhabitant of Big House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be crazy!&rdquo; declared Jack, as she
finished her story. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not have
anything to do with her. Say, what does she
look like?&rdquo; as a sudden idea occurred to him.</p>
<p>Patricia described her as well as she could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The very same!&rdquo; ejaculated the boy, when
Patricia paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; inquired
the girl, looking at him with a puzzled expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was walking along Craig Street, right
back of the campus, you know, one day about
two weeks ago, when I noticed a little woman
ahead of me drop a small bag. Apparently, she
didn&rsquo;t notice her loss; for she kept right on.
I picked up the pocketbook, hurried on, and
gave it to her. She looked at me sharply with
the most piercing brown eyes I have ever
seen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s she!&rdquo; interrupted Patricia. &ldquo;Those
eyes fasten themselves on you just like tiny
crabs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presented the bag and told her where I
found it. She said curtly: &lsquo;So you&rsquo;re really
honest. I didn&rsquo;t think anybody was, any more.&rsquo;
It made me mad, so I merely said: &lsquo;That is
one of the things upon which I pride myself,&rsquo;
bowed and hurried on. I wouldn&rsquo;t swear to it,
but I thought I heard her laugh. Must be
cuckoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s certainly queer, to say the least,&rdquo;
agreed Patricia. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d better go in, now.
Thanks for the movie; I enjoyed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; urged the boy, laying a
hand on her arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see the
Greystone game; aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; Frances and I are going to drive down
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get your tickets, then. I&rsquo;d like you to
be where you can get a good view, since you&rsquo;ve
never been to a real big game before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot,&rdquo; said Patricia gratefully,
as she started up the steps. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring them to you in Shakespeare class
Friday,&rdquo; called Jack, just as Norman and
Clarice came out onto the porch.</p>
<p>Shortly after the street was again deserted,
a masculine figure slipped out of a thick clump
of shrubbery near the dormitory, and, keeping
well in the heavy shadows which edged Arnold
Hall on one side, slunk off into the darkness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />JACK OR TUT?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Will somebody stop that bell!&rdquo; called Patricia
frantically one afternoon a week later.</p>
<p>She and Anne were in their room, trying to
cram for a test in French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; shouted Clarice and Hazel simultaneously.
&ldquo;We want to wear out the battery
before tonight; and the coast is clear now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia gave her door a shove which made
it close with a bang, and stuffed her fingers
into her ears, while Anne did likewise. Presently
the door flew open again to admit Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo; she exclaimed, viewing
the two girls with alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That awful bell!&rdquo; replied Anne briefly,
withdrawing her fingers from ears. &ldquo;What do
you suppose Clarice and Hazel are up to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think they&rsquo;re planning
to step out tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose Troy?&rdquo; queried Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Mary anxiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Rose Troy was not a student at Granard,
but at one of the college affairs to which outsiders
were admitted, she had met Hazel and
Clarice, taken a fancy to them, and subsequently
invited them to her home several
times. She entertained lavishly, and some of
the girls were frankly envious of the favored
two; others strongly disapproved of the growing
intimacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the bell got to do with it?&rdquo; inquired
Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor innocent!&rdquo; retorted Mary. &ldquo;If
the bell won&rsquo;t ring when the back door is
opened&mdash;and they find some way to have said
back door opened for them&mdash;Doll can never tell
what time the girls come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Hazel hadn&rsquo;t gotten so intimate with
Clarice all of a sudden,&rdquo; mused Anne. &ldquo;I
wonder how it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birds of a feather,&rdquo; began Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Hazel is just like Clarice!&rdquo;
protested Anne vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I finish,&rdquo; countered Mary calmly.
&ldquo;I was going to say that they both love a good
time, and both let their studying go until the
eleventh hour; furthermore, Hazel is terribly
restless this year. I can&rsquo;t make out just what
is the matter with her, and Clarice is a kind
of outlet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose Troy&rsquo;s attentions are very bad for
both of them, I think; and perhaps partly explains
their intimacy,&rdquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Mary bluntly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they have a common interest in which
the rest of us have no part, and Rose&rsquo;s parties
are somewhat stimulating, I imagine; more
sophisticated than ours. Rose has lots of boy
friends, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought we to do anything, about tonight, I
wonder,&rdquo; mused Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Mary promptly. &ldquo;What right
have we to object if those two silly kids want
to run the risk of getting into trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly the bell stopped ringing, and quiet
settled down upon the house, just as Mrs.
Vincent entered the front door, with her
shadow, Ivan Zahn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; persisted Patricia, still puzzled,
&ldquo;how will they manage to get in without
Dolly&rsquo;s knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Clarice, on some pretext or other&mdash;she&rsquo;ll
know how&mdash;will ask for permission for
both of them to stay out an hour later than
usual. Doll will give it, and go to bed at the
regular time. Then, with the back door key,
which I suppose they will secure during the
early evening, they will be able to get in and go
to bed without anyone being the wiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice certainly has some stand-in with
Dolly,&rdquo; observed Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She works hard enough for it,&rdquo; retorted
Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Clarice is always sending Doll flowers,
or candy, and naturally it makes an &lsquo;imprint&rsquo;;
as of course it&rsquo;s intended to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>About two o&rsquo;clock next morning, Patricia
was suddenly wakened by a flash of light. Wide
awake in an instant, she waited tensely for
the peal of thunder which she expected would
accompany it&mdash;forgetting that the season for
such storms was over. Electric storms were
Patricia&rsquo;s chief phobia; but no sound disturbed
the stillness. Then the flash was repeated;
again she waited, but again perfect quiet
reigned. Just as she decided that one of the
street lights must be blinking, a third time the
light played on the wall, this time more slowly.
With a fast-beating heart, she sat up, reached
for her bathrobe, and stole softly to the window.
On the path below, in the faint light from the
street lamp, she could distinguish Clarice and
Hazel. Evidently they could not get in, and
had used a flash light to attract her attention.
How to let them know that she saw them, without
making any noise, was a problem which she
solved by passing a handkerchief back and
forth near the screen, hoping that its whiteness
would be visible against the dark background
of the room. Frantic gestures toward the back
door answered her efforts. They must have
forgotten the key. Creeping noiselessly toward
her door, Patricia succeeded in opening
it quietly and stealing down the hall without
arousing anyone. Fortunately, the door into
the narrow passage leading to the back entrance
was open, and Patricia drew it carefully
to behind her, in order to keep any sounds from
the front of the house. With her heart in her
throat, she turned the key, bit by bit, until the
lock was released. With the same care, she
opened the door wide enough to admit the two
girls who were pressed close to its frame. As
she was about to close it again, she noticed a
bright light in Big House&mdash;in the room occupied
by Norman Young. There was a slight
jar as the door settled into place again, and
the three girls stood silent, shaking with
nervous chills, until they felt quite sure that
no one had been wakened. Then, without a
word, they all crept to their rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Come on up to the Coffee Shoppe with me
for lunch, Pat,&rdquo; begged Hazel the following
noon, as they left the house with the rest of
the crowd for Horton Hall. &ldquo;I want to talk
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one of the cozy stalls at the back of the
restaurant, after their order was filled, Hazel
began bluntly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sport, Pat. It was darned
white of you to let us in last night, and never
say a word about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the party worth the trouble?&rdquo; asked
Patricia, playing with the salt cellar nervously,
and not knowing exactly what to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To be frank, it was not. I never had such
a fright in my life. Rose&rsquo;s party was all right.
We had fun, out, after the eats, one of the
boys proposed driving out to Kleg&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>road</i> house?&rdquo; exclaimed Patricia.</p>
<p>Hazel nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody seemed keen to go, so I wasn&rsquo;t
going to be a spoilsport. When we got there,
we found a big crowd, and had trouble getting
tables together. Luckily Clarice and I, and a
couple of fellows you don&rsquo;t know, got places
in a back corner near a side door, like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hazel placed a piece of roll and a match
on the table to show the exact relative location.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t been there half an hour when
there was a raid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hazel!&rdquo; gasped Patricia, with horror in
her eyes and voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the first excitement was going on in
the front room the two fellows who were with
us hustled us quietly out of the side door, into
Pete&rsquo;s car, and brought us home. And were
we lucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how lucky,&rdquo; said Patricia
gravely. &ldquo;Did you see this morning&rsquo;s paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t tell me it was reported!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were our names in?&rdquo; demanded Hazel
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yours or Clarice&rsquo;s, but several of the
men&rsquo;s, as well as Rose&rsquo;s and her sister&rsquo;s. Only
for a kind Providence, you and Clarice might
have been included,&rdquo; said Patricia severely,
gazing sternly at the white-faced girl opposite
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo; declared Hazel finally. &ldquo;This
is the last time I&rsquo;ll break the college rules;
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Rose?&rdquo; added Patricia.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not good for you, Hazel. You haven&rsquo;t
the time or money to go with anyone like that;
and her ideals and standards are different from
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hazel looked at her plate and was silent so
long, that Patricia began to feel as if she had
been too frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, I guess,&rdquo; she said finally.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her up, even though I suppose she&rsquo;ll
think I am an awful quitter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; commended Patricia
heartily, beginning again on her lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose, Pat,&rdquo; asked Hazel, after a
short pause, &ldquo;that the college authorities will
hear that Clarice and I were mixed up in the
affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine so; the others were all
outsiders, weren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but, Pats; at Kleg&rsquo;s I saw Norman
Young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he see you?&rdquo; inquired Patricia sharply,
recalling Jack&rsquo;s impression of the blond youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so; but you never can tell.
He was at a table half way down the room;
and Pat, who do you suppose was with him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Our</i> Rhoda?&rdquo; repeated Patricia, unbelievingly.</p>
<p>Hazel nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s say anything about it to <i>any</i>body,&rdquo;
proposed Patricia after a minute&rsquo;s
thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awfully queer, but since we can&rsquo;t
understand it, there&rsquo;s no object in creating talk
and making things unpleasant for Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. I like Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all do, and I guess she needs her job.
She said something one day about some one being
dependent on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Norman goes with her?&rdquo;
continued Hazel, scraping up the last of her
chocolate pudding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any idea. He&rsquo;s been out with
Clarice quite often of late. I hope she doesn&rsquo;t
hear about Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she saw them last night, and
I didn&rsquo;t mention it. But Clarice wouldn&rsquo;t care,
as long as she had somebody to step out with.
It&rsquo;s a case of <i>some</i> boy with her, not any particular
one,&rdquo; replied Hazel, getting up and
dropping her purse just outside the stall.</p>
<p>At the same moment a youth, leaving the
next stall, picked up the purse and handed it
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; murmured Hazel, glancing up
at the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>To her amazement and distress, she looked
full into the pale grey eyes of Norman Young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going back to college?&rdquo; he asked, looking
first at Hazel and then at Patricia, who had
just slipped out of her seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Patricia briefly, when Hazel
did not respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I. Guess I&rsquo;ll walk along with you,
if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; continued the boy, following
them out of the shop.</p>
<p>Once on the street, he began to talk about
the Greystone game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of money up on that game,&rdquo;
he remarked. &ldquo;Not only among the students,
but also among the townsfolk. Greystone has
a player almost as famous as our Dunn, and
the betting between the two factions is heavy.
If Dunn were to be out of the game for any
reason&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be likely to keep him out?&rdquo;
inquired Hazel sharply, while Patricia listened
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; laughed Norman;
&ldquo;probably nothing at all. I was only mentioning
an improbable chance of such a thing. But,
if he were, the Greystone supporters would be
in line to win a heap of dough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a place is Greystone?&rdquo; asked
Hazel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About the size of Granard. People of the
town are just as loyal to their college as we
are here. Maybe a little rougher crowd than
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Tut Miller has any chance of
being put in for part of the game?&rdquo; asked
Patricia anxiously, the conversation of the
morning recurring to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; questioned the boy,
looking straight into Patricia&rsquo;s eyes with a
peculiar, twisted smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must know all the gridiron gossip,&rdquo;
asserted Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I? I&rsquo;m neither coach nor
manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you watch practice a lot,&rdquo; said
Patricia before Hazel could reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he inquired curtly.</p>
<p>Patricia laughed. &ldquo;Did you ever know anything
to be kept quiet in a college community?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norman looked searchingly at her for a
moment, then replied gravely: &ldquo;Yes, a few
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached Clinton Hall by that time,
and the girls left Norman at the steps with a
hasty &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going in here. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat!&rdquo; gasped Hazel, clasping the other
girl&rsquo;s arm in a frenzied grasp as they hurried
along the hall toward their classroom. &ldquo;Do you
suppose he heard what we were talking about
at lunch? He was evidently in the stall next
to us, all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so. We were talking very
low,&rdquo; replied Patricia kindly, pressing Hazel&rsquo;s
cold fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acted very funny, I thought,&rdquo; chattered
Hazel, trying to control the nervous chills
which shook her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull yourself together,&rdquo; ordered Patricia
sternly. &ldquo;If he did, we can&rsquo;t change it by
getting wrought up over it; but I think we&rsquo;ll
just take it for granted that he didn&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t
worry,&rdquo; she added, as they entered Professor
Donnell&rsquo;s classroom.</p>
<p>Patricia gave good advice to others, but
during the class which followed, her mind dwelt
persistently and anxiously on Norman&rsquo;s reference
to Jack&rsquo;s <i>possibly</i> being out of the
game. Had Joe some secret influence which
might, at the last minute, result in Tut getting
his chance? Did Norman have some inside information?
Or was his supposition as casual
as he tried to make it sound. Ought she to
tell Jack, or would that tend to make things
worse?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Randall,&rdquo; Professor Donnell&rsquo;s
smooth voice broke into her reveries,
&ldquo;<i>de quoi avons nous lu?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>De foot balle</i>,&rdquo; replied Patricia promptly;
then realized, too late, what an absurd reply
she had made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Everybody laughed and turned around to
look at her. Crimson with embarrassment, Patricia
slid as low in her seat as she could, without
landing on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ce n&rsquo;est pas etrange</i>,&rdquo; Professor Donnell
smiled his oily smile as he passed a long white
hand over his star-like hair. &ldquo;<i>Tout le monde
parle, et pense, et entende ne que de footballe.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />A TOUGH PROPOSITION</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys,&rdquo; said Coach Tyler on Friday
afternoon, at the close of a meeting of the football
team, &ldquo;take the rest of the day off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tyler did not believe in working a team up
to the very last minute, and never had his men
on the field the day before a big game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take things easy,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Drop
football out of your minds and conversation.
Stay out of doors as much as possible. Don&rsquo;t
do anything exciting, and get to bed early. The
train leaves South Street Station at 8:30, and
I want you here in the gym at eight sharp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a little spin,&rdquo; suggested Tut
Miller to Jack Dunn as they strolled out onto
the campus. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only half past one. Tyler
is certainly getting big-hearted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a paper to write for&mdash;&rdquo; began
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on!&rdquo; urged Tut, dragging him
toward a yellow roadster parked on the drive.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to do that later.
Some friends of mine want to meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Jack got into the car, wondering
a little at the unusual request. Tut settled
himself in the driver&rsquo;s seat, quickly swung the
machine out onto Grover Road, and headed for
the country. Jack had never been very chummy
with this big blond Soph with the protruding
jaw and narrowed eyes which looked at you
speculatively, as if you were a bug under a
microscope. He was always friendly, almost
too friendly; one sometimes wondered if he
were laughing scornfully, away down inside of
him.</p>
<p>Neither boy spoke until they had turned onto
Route 8, one very little traveled at that hour
of the day; then Tut began smoothly: &ldquo;These
friends of mine live about ten miles out on this
road; some fellows I knew in prep school.
They&rsquo;re awfully keen on football, and like to
be able to say they&rsquo;ve met this or that celebrity.
Been at me for some time to bring you out.
They run a big roadside stand; have several
cabins, and I guess they&rsquo;re making a pretty
good thing of it; always have plenty of dough
to spend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>Jack, for all his popularity, was a modest
fellow and hated being shown off. If he had
known where they were going, he would have
managed to evade the trip; but Tut had trapped
him, fairly and squarely. Nothing for it now
but to get the meeting over with as quickly as
possible.</p>
<p>Tut drove rapidly, and before long drew up
at a tourist camp in a grove some feet back
from the road. Three fellows a little older
than the Granard boys came out to greet them.
They were husky, finely built individuals, all
with bright red hair, blue eyes, and a strong
family resemblance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Holm brothers,&rdquo; said Tut, with a wave
of his hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to tell you boys
who this is!&rdquo; slapping Jack on the back.
&ldquo;Everybody knows him, at least by sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty glad to meet you,&rdquo; said each in
turn, as he grasped Jack&rsquo;s hand in a vise-like
grip.</p>
<p>The five stood for a few minutes talking of
various unimportant matters; then Seldon, the
oldest Holm, proposed showing Jack around
the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of our cabins are pretty nice,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;and farther back in the grove there is
a stream beside which we have built ovens and
tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernard, the second brother, promptly
moved to their side as Jack murmured a polite
assent to the proposal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here with Vin,&rdquo; said Tut, &ldquo;and
help keep store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Seldon and Bernard had proudly displayed
their property, of which Jack was able
to approve quite honestly, they stopped for a
moment at a rustic bridge which led back from
the picnic grounds to a deep woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a proposition to make to you, Dunn,&rdquo;
began Seldon abruptly, &ldquo;somewhat of a surprise
to you, and probably not a very agreeable
one; but just keep cool and think it over
a bit before you decide. Briefly, it&rsquo;s this: we
Huron Prep fellows always hang together, and
let nothing stand in the way of promoting the
welfare and reputation of our school. We want
Tut to have his big chance in the Greystone
game. Now, what will you take to stay out
of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a fleeting second, Jack&rsquo;s impulse was to
knock the fellow over into the stream below;
but some more cautious instinct immediately
urged upon him the wisdom of proceeding carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; began Jack, as slowly as his fast-beating
heart would allow, &ldquo;naturally, since
I&rsquo;ve never given a thought to such a question,
I&rsquo;m not prepared to answer it on the spur of
the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your time,&rdquo; urged Bernard, pulling
out a cigarette and lighting it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s brain fairly raced. If he refused,
since they strongly outnumbered him, they
could readily keep him a prisoner until after
the game. Yet to accept was definitely out of
the question; he&rsquo;d be just a plain cur to take
a bribe. How could he get away from them
without either definitely accepting or refusing?
That seemed to be his only chance. What an
easy mark he had been!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long am I to have to decide?&rdquo; he
asked, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until Tut&rsquo;s ready to go back,&rdquo; replied Seldon,
who, leaning against a big oak tree, was
watching Jack closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to where the others are,&rdquo; suggested
Jack; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to talk to Tut before
I decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No objection to that, I guess,&rdquo; replied
Bernard, looking at his brother. Not a chance
of this fellow getting away when there were
four of them to prevent such a contingency.
Much better for Dunn to accept the bribe (for
that meant Tut would have his place for the
next two years, as well as at the Greystone
game) than it would be to have to keep him
prisoner until after Saturday. Why had the
fellows urged Tut&rsquo;s being helped with his
course at Granard except so that Huron could
have a representative on the big team? Tut
had played mighty good football at prep school,
but this upstart kept him from his rightful
place here. Pity they hadn&rsquo;t gotten rid of
him before. It took the Greystone game to
wake them all up. The Greystone supporters
would be glad to see Dunn out of the game;
they didn&rsquo;t know how good Tut was.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get down to business,&rdquo; said Seldon
briskly, when they joined the others who
were standing at the edge of the grove. &ldquo;Tut,
Dunn wants to talk over the proposition with
you before he decides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack managed to get on the outside of the
group, from which point he had a straight and
unobstructed path to the yellow car which was
parked at the farthest point of the Holm property
and headed toward Granard. Tut must
have turned it around so as to be ready for a
quick get-away if necessary. The Holms probably
had a car; but it was not in sight. Wherever
they kept it, it would take at least a few
minutes to get it started and out. True, Tut
could have him arrested for going off with his
car, but he&rsquo;d have to run the risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Tut was saying, &ldquo;spill it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should decide to take the money, how
would you explain my absence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you&rsquo;d play up sick, and just
stay at home,&rdquo; put in Seldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be sheer foolishness,&rdquo; retorted
Jack. &ldquo;Tyler would send Doc to examine me,
and he&rsquo;d find me perfectly O. K. How would
it do for me to go to Greystone, just as if
nothing had happened, and start the game;
then get hurt and have you put in in my
place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would seem more natural,&rdquo; answered
Tut, looking at Seldon for approval; but that
sturdy individual frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you fake that any better than
being sick before you went?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this way. I&rsquo;d make a run, stumble,
fall, and lie still on the field. When they
picked me up, I&rsquo;d go limp and not be able to
stand at all. I could fool anybody who&rsquo;d never
seen me do it before. Let me show you what
I mean, and then see if you don&rsquo;t think it would
work out perfectly. When I fall, you come and
try to stand me up, Tut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack looked questioningly at the Holms for
permission to stage his act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; replied Seldon curtly.</p>
<p>Instead of making directly for the yellow
roadster, as he had intended, Jack cleverly ran
about a bit, close enough to the others for them
to have been able to seize him any moment
they chose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just warming up a bit,&rdquo; he said,
smiling, as he passed the group for the second
time. &ldquo;In a minute or two I&rsquo;ll put on my act.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>Jack sensed, rather than saw, that the tenseness
with which they had watched his start relaxed
somewhat as he continued to warm up.
Then like a catapult he hurled himself forward
and sprinted to the car. With a bound he was
in the driver&rsquo;s seat, the ignition was on, the
clutch was thrown in, the car shot out onto the
road. Wild shouts from those left behind.</p>
<p>Jack realized that it would be foolhardy to
stay on Route 8; so at the first crossroad he
turned off into a road which he thought would
bring him out at Portersville, a suburb of
Granard. The road was a winding one, but he
made good time and met no other cars. He
kept close watch in the mirror for his pursuers,
but the road behind him basked quietly in the
afternoon sunshine.</p>
<p>Just as he turned into the road leading into
Portersville, a stretch of heavily wooded highway,
he saw a big blue car coming toward him.
In it were four big fellows wearing blue and
green ribbons in their buttonholes&mdash;Greystone
colors. All this, Jack took in at a glance as
he sped onward. The blue car slowed down,
turned around, stopped for a moment, then
came on with a burst of speed, passed him
and swung sharply across the road, directly
in his path. It was so unexpected that Jack
had to jam on the brakes suddenly to avoid
crashing into the larger car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;&rdquo; he began angrily, when he noticed
that the three individuals who had tumbled out
of the car and were coming toward him had
handkerchiefs tied over the lower part of their
faces.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A hold-up!&rdquo; thought Jack. &ldquo;Foolhardy to
try to resist them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word they seized him, dragged
him out of the yellow roadster, then two of
them hurried him over to the blue car while
the third moved the smaller car over onto the
shoulder. A blindfold was tied tightly over
Jack&rsquo;s eyes, he was tumbled into the tonneau,
and the big car started off for&mdash;somewhere.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />JACK IN DANGER</h2>
<p>At first Jack was too stunned by the suddenness
of the transfer to talk, but after a
few dizzy miles, he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; ordered a harsh voice, accompanied
by a dig in the ribs; and he shut up.</p>
<p>Not a word did any of his captors exchange,
and mile after mile whirled by in utter silence.
Where he might be, he had no idea whatever.
After endless eons, so it seemed to Jack, the
car began to move more slowly and wind about,
then came to a sudden stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>He was hustled out, run across some gravel,
up a few steps. A door slammed, footsteps on
stone, then up stairs, and stairs, and more
stairs. A key turned protestingly. A door
creaked; there was a blast of cool air; he was
pushed into some place. Then the door closed,
and the key grated a second time. The sound
of footsteps on stairs sounded more and more
faintly; then silence, broken only by a peculiar
grating sound from somewhere above him.</p>
<p>Where could he be?</p>
<p>Pulling the bandage from his eyes he discovered
that he was in a small square room
with slatted walls. It looked like a belfry. Yes,
there was a great bell just above his head, almost
touching it. If that mass of metal ever
moved, it would put him out of business in
short order all right. What tower was this
anyhow? He tried to peer out between the slats.
The only object within his narrow range of
vision was the framework of some new building.
What big structure was going up now in
town, or nearby? He tried hard to think, but
he still felt a little dazed. How stupid! Who
knew where he was now? They had been riding
for a long time; he might be miles and miles
from Granard. Still, there was something
annoyingly familiar about that naked, orange-colored
framework out there, with the big 0032
in black on the top girder. Again he peered
at it. It must be&mdash;it was! The new forestry
building at the University! Then this was the
tower of the old chapel. His captors had evidently
entered the campus from the alley gate
at the back, where no one would be likely to see
them. That accounted for the gravel they had
crossed. They had driven for miles, first, to
throw him off. But how strange of the gang to
have brought him here! Who were they, and
what was their game anyhow?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Game? Ah, that must be it! He remembered
now; there was a lot of money up on the
Greystone struggle, not only on the campus but
even in the town; and if he were out of the
contest, Granard stood to lose&mdash;so it was said.
Evidently those fellows were Greystone supporters.
He remembered now they had worn
Greystone colors. Darned clever of them to
put him where he would have no evidence,
when he got out, and where no one would ever
think to look for him.</p>
<p>But how to get out; that was the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing it&rsquo;s not Sunday, for that big
fellow to knock me out!&rdquo; he thought, looking
up at the bell. A horrible thought came to him.
The boys were going to have a rouser that
night; everybody out in front of the gym before
dinner for songs and speeches. They&rsquo;d
ring that bell to call the students together; and
the janitor pulled the rope from a little room
at the foot of the stairs! What time was it
now? Glancing at his wrist he was shocked to
find it bare. Where was his watch? Must have
come unfastened in the car.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>One, two, three, sounded the bell of a clock
in the distance. The clock on the college library.
Breathlessly, Jack listened. Four. One
hour&mdash;one little hour of sixty minutes to devise
a means of escape. Frantically he shook the
door. Only the flutter of wings, as some startled
pigeons arose from the roof, answered his
plea.</p>
<p>Panting for breath, he paused; then began
to batter the slats of one panel with his fists.
They were stout, and withstood the blows of
even a husky football player.</p>
<p>He must keep his head and work rationally.
There were only two means of exit: the door
and the four slatted windows. Again he shook
the door, not wildly, but listening critically.
Perhaps he could pick the lock.</p>
<p>Eagerly he felt in his pockets for his knife
and buttonhook. Only a crumpled handkerchief,
a pencil, a soft package of butterscotch,
and a ball of twine rewarded his efforts. The
door was now out of the question. What in
heck had become of his knife? Had those fellows
purposely stripped him of everything so
he couldn&rsquo;t possibly get out? To do them
justice, however, he supposed they didn&rsquo;t know
about the ringing of the bell for the rouser,
and probably intended him to be secure until
after the game.</p>
<p>One, two; one, two, chimed the library clock.
Four-fifteen! Nothing accomplished yet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I could get the slats broken, and then
lean out of the window and yell for help,&rdquo; he
said, half aloud.</p>
<p>A squeak on the stairs outside of the door
caught his ear. &ldquo;Wonder if they left a guard
around,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;If I yelled, they would
only come in and gag me; and that would make
things worse than they are now. My only hope,
a forlorn one at that, is to attract the attention
of someone in order to let the fellows know
where I am, and come to rescue me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But how?</p>
<p>Covering his face with his hands, he crouched
on the floor, in deep thought.</p>
<p>One, chimed the library clock, marking the
half hour. Anxiously Jack glanced up at the
heavy bell above him. Perhaps he could unfasten
the clapper, and flatten himself on the
floor so that the bell would only graze him
as it swung to and fro. Then, when no sound
came from the belfry, somebody might investigate.
But no; old Jake, who attended to
the bell ringing, was too lazy to climb all those
stairs to repair the bell for a mere rally. He&rsquo;d
just let it go until some time tomorrow. By
that time, the team would have left without
him!</p>
<p>The tickets he had promised Patricia were
lying home on his desk. Wonder what she
thought when he failed to keep his promise to
give them to her in Shakespeare class.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>Tut&rsquo;s friends would probably pass around
the word that Jack had taken the bribe and
disappeared. That would be his finish in athletics.
Jack groaned aloud, and pulled his
handkerchief from his pocket to wipe off the
cold perspiration which dampened his face. Tut
had always been jealous of him; and since he
had refused, a few weeks ago, to work for Jim&rsquo;s
election as Chairman of the Soph Hop, Tut had
positively disliked him. Jack did not approve
of the bargaining for honors, which went on
at the college, but doggedly supported whatever
man he thought best fitted for the job, politics
notwithstanding&mdash;a practice which had not
made him any too popular with certain ambitious
ringleaders.</p>
<p>The sight of his handkerchief gave him a
sudden inspiration. Quickly tearing it in half,
he scrawled on one part of it, in large letters,
&ldquo;HELP! QUICK!&rdquo; Knotting one end of the
ball of twine to it, he painstakingly worked the
bit of linen between the slats of the window
which faced the observatory, and played out
the cord as far as it would go. Fastening the
end of it securely to one of the shutters, he
took the other half of the handkerchief, slipped
it through between the slats, and tied it about
in the center of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve done all I can,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
on the laps of the gods, for better or worse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>The part of the campus on which the chapel
stood was deserted during the week. In a
rather out-of-the-way place, beyond the other
buildings, it was in the least frequented corner
of the campus. Jack&rsquo;s captors planned all too
well when they chose the belfry for his prison.</p>
<p>One, two, one, two, chimed the library clock.
A quarter to five! Would <i>nobody</i> find his
message or see his poor little flag? If he could
only have stood up and tramped around a bit,
it would have relieved Jack&rsquo;s feelings somewhat;
but the belfry was large enough only
for the moving of the single bell. Would he
be safer flat on the floor, directly under the
bell, or as far to one side as he could get, when
it began to swing?</p>
<p>One, two, three, four, chimed the clock. A
door slammed somewhere downstairs; the bell
rope trembled; the bell quivered; Jack
stretched out on the floor as flat as he could,
and waited for the first blow of the iron mass.</p>
<p>Swift steps on the stairs, the turning of a
key, hands dragging him quickly out of the way,
just as the first clang of the big bell sounded
deafeningly through the little room. Jack found
himself in the hall with Pat and Ted bending
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just in the nick of time, old man!&rdquo; cried
Ted, grinning cheerfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop to talk!&rdquo; ordered Patricia frantically.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get out of here right away!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Down the stairs they rushed, while the bell
clanged and clanged overhead. Pat&rsquo;s car, with
all shades drawn, was waiting close to the
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in back,&rdquo; directed Ted; &ldquo;crawl behind
those cartons and don&rsquo;t breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second time that day, Jack was driven
off, he knew not where.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there, Ted,&rdquo; called Joe Leonard, as they
stopped for lights at the corner of College
Avenue and Elizabeth Street. &ldquo;Come on to the
meeting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you later,&rdquo; replied Ted; &ldquo;got to deliver
these fruit jars for my mother first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if he&rsquo;s onto us,&rdquo; whispered Patricia,
as they started forward with a jerk.</p>
<p>Ted only shrugged his shoulders and drove
as rapidly as possible to the apartment he and
his mother shared on Winton Street. At the
side entrance, where Mrs. Carter was waiting
to admit them, Ted hustled Jack into the house
and up a back stairway to his own room; meanwhile,
Patricia drove her car farther back into
the yard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going to keep you here tonight, old fellow,&rdquo;
said Ted, slapping Jack on the back. &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;ll
ever think of looking for you here; and
we&rsquo;ll see you safe on the train in the morning.
No college people in this house, and we have a
back apartment. We&rsquo;ll keep the shades drawn
as an extra precaution. Right across the hall
from this room is the door to the attic. If anybody
comes tonight to call, just beat it for the
loft and slip in behind the big dresser which is
near the chimney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat will tell you all about it later; for
Mother asked her to stay to dinner. Wash a bit
if you want to, and then go out to the living
room. I&rsquo;ll have to show up at the meeting for
a while, I suppose, in case Jim takes a notion
to look for me. Don&rsquo;t want to arouse any suspicions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still in somewhat of a daze, Jack made himself
tidy and then went out to the living room.
Aunt Betsy was busy in the kitchen, and Patricia
sat alone by the bay window which overhung
the side door by which they had entered.
The girl smiled a bit shyly as Jack came in and
crossed the room to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I you to thank for my rescue?&rdquo; he
asked, taking her hands in both of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, partly,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But Ted
helped a lot. He&rsquo;s always been my stand-by in
moments of difficulty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you didn&rsquo;t show up in Shakespeare
class,&rdquo; she continued, as Jack dropped down at
the other end of the davenport, &ldquo;I knew right
away something must have happened. You
see,&rdquo; her head dropped a bit, &ldquo;I heard something
this morning about the possibility of your
being out of the game; and, oh, it seemed only
a joking reference, but I was too stupid, I
guess, to have attached enough importance to
it. I <i>did</i> wonder if I should say anything to
you about it, put you on your guard; and now,
oh, how I wish I had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get all steamed up over it,&rdquo; urged
Jack; &ldquo;it came out all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it <i>mightn&rsquo;t</i> have. If I hadn&rsquo;t happened
to go to the observatory perhaps nobody would
have seen your flag; and&mdash;and then, if you&rsquo;d
been struck by that old bell, it would have been
all my fault!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Jack, laying his arm
gently around her shoulders. He was distressed
beyond measure by the girl&rsquo;s self-accusation.
&ldquo;I was lying so flat that the bell probably
would only have grazed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determinedly Pat pulled herself together and
sat up very straight, winking hard and fast to
keep back the tears which, much to her embarrassment,
had welled up in her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After Shakespeare class,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;I got away from the rest of the girls&mdash;I always
want to be alone if I have anything to
work out in my mind&mdash;and wandered about the
most deserted parts of the campus trying to
decide what to do. I don&rsquo;t know all the ins and
outs of college affairs yet, and I was afraid of
telling my suspicions to the wrong person. As
I passed the observatory, I remembered having
left my fountain pen in the lecture room; so I
ran up to get it. Nobody was in there, and I
sat down by the window thinking that was a
good place to be quiet. The sun shone full on
the side of the chapel, and it was no time at all
before I caught sight of the white flag waving
in the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nearly broke all records running down
the stairs and along the path toward the chapel.
Not far from the building, I found your appeal
for help. I felt sure it <i>was</i> your appeal. I tore
off the cloth, so nobody else would find it, and
ran for Ted. I knew he was in the library. I
hadn&rsquo;t thought about the meeting; but Ted did,
right away, and realized what danger you were
in. Ted grabbed up a couple of empty cartons
that stood in the hall, ready to be thrown out,
dumped them and ourselves into my car
(which, fortunately, was standing in front of
the library) and we just rushed to your rescue.
Luckily, all the students were swarming over
the front campus, waiting for the meeting; so
no one, so far as we know, saw us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did you get the key?&rdquo; inquired
Jack, still somewhat in the dark as to details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ted has a master key. He has to get
into Forestry Hall at all sorts of odd times.
He was sure his key could be used on the belfry
door, and he was right. If it hadn&rsquo;t fitted, he
would have had to let Jake in on the rescue, but
it was better not; the fewer people knew about
it, the safer we were.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how I can get hold of those tickets
for you. I might telephone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! No!&rdquo; protested Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce does he want you to do,
Pat?&rdquo; inquired Ted, strolling in just in time
to hear his cousin&rsquo;s vigorous refusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I could go over to your room in the
morning and get them,&rdquo; offered Ted, when
Patricia had excitedly explained the subject of
their discussion; &ldquo;after the train goes, that is,
for I&rsquo;m not letting you out of my sight before
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dinner&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; announced Mrs. Carter,
appearing in the dining room doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re ready for it, Auntie,&rdquo; replied
Patricia, jumping up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no end good of you all to take me in
like this,&rdquo; began Jack, as they seated themselves
at the little round table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For dear old Granard, I&rsquo;ll live and die!&rdquo;
carolled Ted. &ldquo;Now tell us all about the great
abduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack was in the middle of the story of his
capture, when the telephone rang sharply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />AUNT BETSY TO THE RESCUE</h2>
<p>Ted sprang to answer the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Ted. Yes, she is. Who is it, please?
Just a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, putting his hand over the transmitter:
&ldquo;Pat, Norman Young wants to speak
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; responded his cousin, getting
up so suddenly that her chair toppled over
backwards and fell to the floor with a loud
crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m throwing you to the phone,&rdquo;
commented Ted with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! You wanted to speak to me? What?
He is? Why, how should I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat was nervously clenching and unclenching
her left hand as she talked, and frowning
heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not! He&rsquo;s probably out for the
evening, and I don&rsquo;t see that you or anybody
else has a right to meddle with his things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t burn up, Pat,&rdquo; advised her cousin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps,&rdquo; she admitted grudgingly
to the man at the other end of the telephone.
&ldquo;Certainly. No, you may not; my cousin will
take me home. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia hung up the receiver with a bang,
threw herself into the chair which Jack had
meanwhile righted, leaned her elbows on the
table and announced explosively: &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s
anybody in this college whom I cordially dislike,
it&rsquo;s Norman Young!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what did he have to say?&rdquo; inquired
Ted, calmly helping himself to another piece of
beefsteak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that Jack was missing, and
wanted to know if I knew where he was. The
nerve of him! Somebody sent him to Jack&rsquo;s
room, looking for Jack, and our smart Norman
found an envelope on the desk addressed to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tickets,&rdquo; interpolated Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he wanted to know,&rdquo; went on Patricia,
&ldquo;if he should bring it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a meddler,&rdquo; said Ted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I put him in his place, he apologized;
and then wanted to know if he couldn&rsquo;t call for
me and take me home when I was ready to go.
How did he know I was here, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow smells a rat!&rdquo; announced Ted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly afraid so,&rdquo; admitted Patricia.
&ldquo;Still I think I had better go back to the dorm
right after we finish dinner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; began Jack in protest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I really think it&rsquo;s wiser,&rdquo; said Patricia,
looking at him with a worried expression.</p>
<p>The telephone rang sharply a second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s that pest again!&rdquo; cried
Patricia, as Ted took off the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Oh, hello, Anne. Well, spill it. You
heard what? The deuce he did! Of all the rot
I ever&mdash;To be sure it will. Thanks a lot for
telling me. I&rsquo;ll see what can be done right
away. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s happened now?&rdquo; demanded
Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use in my trying to break the news
gently. Anne says there is a rumor around college
tonight that Jack was offered a big bribe
to stay out of the Greystone game; that he took
it, and has disappeared. Can you beat that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia, speechless with distress, simply
twisted her napkin into a mere rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The curs! The contemptible curs!&rdquo; exploded
Jack. &ldquo;I might have known they&rsquo;d get
even with me some way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s a foundation for that
rumor!&rdquo; cried Ted sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; replied Jack shortly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
mean to tell this; but listen.&rdquo; Rapidly, yet
omitting no important detail, he related the
story of the afternoon previous to his imprisonment
in the belfry. &ldquo;And the worst of it is, I
haven&rsquo;t a single witness. They can say pretty
nearly what they choose, and go unchallenged.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tut&rsquo;s responsible for the rumor, of
course,&rdquo; decided Ted; &ldquo;if we could only corner
him some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; declared Patricia, with vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And make him eat crow!&rdquo; concluded her
cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how?&rdquo; asked Jack, with a short laugh.
&ldquo;Tut&rsquo;s pretty hard-boiled, and who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall,&rdquo; announced Mrs. Carter firmly,
getting up from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Betsy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use objecting. I&rsquo;m going to find him
right now, and I&rsquo;ll promise you to be back with
his scalp before the evening&rsquo;s over. I won&rsquo;t
give any of you away. He doesn&rsquo;t know me
from Adam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eve, you mean, Mother,&rdquo; laughed her son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, now where will I be most likely to find
him?&rdquo; she asked, slipping on her coat and
perching a hat on the back of her head.</p>
<p>Jack looked at the clock. &ldquo;Probably in his
room at No. 9 Craig Street. It&rsquo;s on the second
floor, a single, right opposite the stairs; but
at least let one of us take you as far as the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t. You stay quietly here until I come
back, all of you.&rdquo; With a slam of the door, she
was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>The three young people looked at one another
in speechless astonishment. Finally, Ted
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel kind of sorry for old Tut, much as I
dislike him. Mother will have the truth out of
him if she has to stand him on his head. He&rsquo;ll
do what she says, or she&rsquo;ll know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tension was broken, and they all laughed.</p>
<p>When the table was cleared, Ted announced
that he was going to do the dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll help,&rdquo; said Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t. You two sit in the living
room and chatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia shrugged her shoulders, and led the
way into the next room; extinguished all but
one of the lamps, turned on the gas log, and sat
down before the fire. Jack threw himself on the
hearth rug and propped his back against the
big chair in which Patricia was sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will&mdash;will this do you much harm, do you
suppose?&rdquo; she asked, after a moment&rsquo;s silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard to tell. Of course if I can&rsquo;t be cleared,
it will mean my finish as far as sports are concerned&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all Tut thinks of, naturally. But,
as I told you once before, I think, there is a special
reason why I must make good here; and if
my reputation comes into question, well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack broke off abruptly, and frowned at the
fire. In a moment he continued:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t told anyone else about this, but
I&rsquo;d like you to know; and I&rsquo;m sure it won&rsquo;t go
any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the tenth of last August, I received a
special delivery letter,&rdquo; began Jack slowly,
gazing steadily at the fire.</p>
<p>Patricia leaned forward, breathless with surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that letter,&rdquo; continued the boy, &ldquo;was a
cashier&rsquo;s check for One Thousand Dollars; and
on a slip of paper, the words, &lsquo;For John Dunn,
to be spent on a year at Granard College.&rsquo; We
tried in every way to find out where it came
from, but when all of our efforts were fruitless
we decided that the only thing to do was to use
the money as requested. So you see why I feel
under such heavy obligations to make good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; whispered Patricia, with a little excited
catch in her throat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never told anybody,
either&mdash;not even my aunt or cousin; but
that&rsquo;s exactly what happened to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; cried the boy, twisting around
to look up into her face, &ldquo;that you got money
that same way&mdash;to come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very, very queer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strangeness of the situation silenced
them completely for a time. Then Jack murmured:
&ldquo;This should make us better friends
than ever, shouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Patricia smiled, but she did not withdraw the
hand that Jack imprisoned in both of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it seem sometimes as if you just
<i>must</i> find out who sent the check?&rdquo; asked Jack,
a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and sometimes I feel really nervous
over it, as if somebody whom I couldn&rsquo;t see
were watching me all the time, to make sure
that I behaved properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door flew open at that moment, and Aunt
Betsy darted into the room just as Ted came in
from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she exclaimed, sinking down in a big
chair and throwing off her coat, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve settled
<i>his</i> hash! He&rsquo;s going around now contradicting
the rumor he started, and he&rsquo;ll never bother
<i>you</i> again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for you, Mother!&rdquo; cried Ted. &ldquo;But
tell us the whole story. How did you ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that young man&rsquo;s father; used to go
to school with him. Got him out of an awful
scrape once, and he promised he&rsquo;d do anything
I asked him to pay up for it. Never had any
occasion to before. Told the young fellow about
his dad&rsquo;s promise (though of course not the
reason for it) and said I was now about to ask
him to redeem it. I said I knew what a contemptible
thing he was up to, and that I stood
ready right now to telephone the whole affair
to his dad. Then I just lit into him, told him
what a cad and a coward he is. Told him I&rsquo;d
start a public investigation and testify against
him. Like all conceited blowbags, he collapsed
when under fire; asked what I wanted him to
do, begged me not to tell his father; for he&rsquo;d
take him out of college and put him to work in
the store. Made him tell me just where and to
whom he&rsquo;d told that abominable lie, and told
him I&rsquo;d go with him while he corrected it. &lsquo;You
can call it a joke,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;if you must save your
face.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Betsy laughed contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy fairly groveled, and swore he&rsquo;d
go; that it wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary for me to accompany
him. I waited while he put on his coat,
and started out with him. Watched him go to
two places, and on his way to the third before
I left him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Carter,&rdquo; began Jack, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try. I hate to be thanked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Betsy, you&rsquo;re just wonderful!&rdquo; cried
Patricia gleefully, while Ted shook his mother&rsquo;s
hand violently.</p>
<p>Conversation for the rest of the evening was
general, concerned principally with the prospects
of Granard in the morrow&rsquo;s game. Patricia
apparently forgot her resolution to leave
right after dinner, for it was half past nine
when she drove back to the dorm alone, having
decidedly refused Ted&rsquo;s offer to go with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel lots better if you stayed home and
kept guard,&rdquo; she whispered to him as he protestingly
let her out. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not know that Norman Young had
inspected the interior of the car as it stood in
the back yard; nor that, hidden behind a pillar
on the porch next to the apartment house, he
had watched her come out alone and start for
Arnold Hall.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />ON DUTY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Pats!&rdquo; urged Betty, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s heaps of fun to hear the tryouts,&rdquo;
added Anne; &ldquo;more than seeing the plays
themselves, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The football season was over. The Greystone
game had resulted in a close victory for Granard,
in a hard-fought battle. Jack had covered
himself with glory and made the final score for
his college in the last few minutes of play. Tut
had come down with a heavy cold&mdash;so it was
said&mdash;and had gone home for the Thanksgiving
recess a few days early; so he was absent not
only from the line-up, but also from the game.
All rumors regarding Jack had died a natural
death, and now were nearly forgotten; so rapidly
does one event follow another, and a fresh
excitement take the place of its predecessor, in
college life. The present and the future are the
only tenses the college student knows anything
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>Dramatics now held the center of the stage.</p>
<p>The Alley Gang was standing on the corner
of Wentworth Street and College Avenue after
leaving Horton Hall, and were discussing a
coming production of the dramatic club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll all go to &lsquo;Vans&rsquo; afterward and
get something decent to eat,&rdquo; proposed Frances
enthusiastically. &ldquo;That dinner we just had was
fierce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dinner</i>, did you say?&rdquo; inquired Hazel
scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you go, Pat?&rdquo; asked Jane,
clasping Patricia&rsquo;s arm affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because my theme for English III is due
tomorrow, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not until afternoon,&rdquo; objected Hazel.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have plenty of time to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I won&rsquo;t have,&rdquo; contradicted
Patricia. &ldquo;French test and History review
both in the morning; and with Yates&rsquo; lab
period early in the afternoon. I don&rsquo;t know
when you people do all your work, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; laughed Mary, shifting
rapidly from one foot to the other to keep
warm; for the night was cold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s go somewhere,&rdquo; grumbled Lucile,
sinking her head deeper into her big fur
collar, &ldquo;before we all freeze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia bit her tongue to keep back an angry
response to Lucile&rsquo;s unpleasant tones. She and
Lucile had never hit it off very well, and she
had wondered more than once how the other
girls managed so nonchalantly to put up with
Lu&rsquo;s uncertain moods. Clarice, the &ldquo;black
sheep,&rdquo; was noisy and indiscreet, but at least
she was accommodating and good-natured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all alone in the alley, except for
Clarice,&rdquo; warned Anne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s her night on the
Black Book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can work in peace and quiet, then,&rdquo; replied
Patricia; &ldquo;with all of you &lsquo;hyenas&rsquo; out
of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dodging a threatened blow from Katharine&rsquo;s
sturdy arm, Patricia ran quickly down Wentworth
Street, while the rest of the crowd
started for the auditorium. It was hard to
leave the girls and go back alone to work in the
lonely dormitory; only a strong sense of obligation
to her unknown benefactor saved Patricia
from giving in to the pleas of her pals
and let the theme slide. When she entered the
hall she was surprised to find Rhoda still on
duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s Clarice?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t come in yet,&rdquo; replied the maid,
looking up from some fancy work she was
doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be awfully late for your dinner,
Rhoda. You&rsquo;d better go. I&rsquo;ll stay here until
Clarice comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very kind of you,&rdquo; responded the
girl gratefully, beginning to fold up the long
scarf and lay aside her silks. &ldquo;The chef is
always so put out when the help come in late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he wants to get his work finished,
and go somewhere; we all do. It is only
stern necessity for work on an essay that
brought me back here tonight. The others have
all gone to the tryouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia slipped into the chair which Rhoda
vacated, and watched the maid put on her hat
and coat, thinking how little, after all, they
really knew about her in spite of their association
with her, day after day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, and thank you,&rdquo; said the girl
softly, as she opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, and you&rsquo;re welcome,&rdquo; laughed
Patricia.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes later, the telephone rang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; answered Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda?&rdquo; demanded a thin, sharp voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she has just gone. Is there any message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not,&rdquo; was the curt response, as
the woman at the other end of the line hung
up noisily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now where in the name of fortune have I
heard that voice before?&rdquo; mused Patricia
aloud. &ldquo;Those thin high tones sound oddly
familiar. I know! It was Mrs. Brock! But why
should she telephone Rhoda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia was still puzzling over the question
when the door opened to admit Clarice in a
dull rose dinner gown and a black fur jacket,
followed by Mrs. Vincent, closely wrapped in
a long, grey coat, her face drawn with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice,&rdquo; the chaperon was saying, as they
paused to close the door, &ldquo;tell Ivan when he
comes that I&rsquo;m sorry to break my engagement
with him, but that I&rsquo;m ill and have gone to
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried to her room, without even a
glance at Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How gay you are tonight,&rdquo; observed Patricia,
eyeing the rose-colored gown admiringly
as the girl came over to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the dress darling?&rdquo; inquired Clarice,
opening her jacket to display more fully the
charms beneath it. &ldquo;My father just sent it to
me. You see,&rdquo; perching on the corner of the
table, and swinging her feet, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s just crazy
for me to make good here, and graduate; and
so long as I manage to stick, he&rsquo;ll send me
pretties every once in a while. On the other
hand, if I&rsquo;m flunked out,&rdquo; with a careless laugh,
&ldquo;he threatens to send me off into the country
to live with some old maid cousin whom I&rsquo;ve
never seen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>While Patricia was searching for a suitable
reply to this unusual confidence, the doorbell
rang, and Clarice flew to answer it. A short,
dark youth with bold black eyes, which were
everywhere at once, stepped familiarly in as
soon as the door was opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Zahn,&rdquo; said Clarice, without preamble,
&ldquo;Mrs. Vincent is sorry; but she has a
bad tooth, and has gone to bed. So <i>she</i> won&rsquo;t
be able to go out with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the faintest accent on the word
<i>she</i>, as Clarice smiled mischievously upon the
young man. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
he caught the suggestion and replied suavely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you would take her place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve got to work tonight,&rdquo; laughed
Clarice, &ldquo;unless&mdash;&rdquo; turning to glance inquiringly
at Patricia, &ldquo;are you going to be here
all the evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the brief reply, as Patricia
turned over the pages of a magazine, trying
not to listen in on the conversation going on
near the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking my place,
would you?&rdquo; begged Clarice, clattering noisily
across the polished floor on her high-heeled
rose slippers to lean on the table and smile
coaxingly at Patricia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do the same for
you some time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied Patricia, without enthusiasm,
for she did not at all approve of
Clarice&rsquo;s going off with Mrs. Vincent&rsquo;s friend;
yet did not feel at liberty to try to dissuade
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, darling!&rdquo; was Clarice&rsquo;s grateful
response. A hasty kiss on the tip of Patricia&rsquo;s
nose, a dash across the hall, the opening and
closing of a door, and they were gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to goodness Mrs. Vincent doesn&rsquo;t
come out and ask for Clarice! I don&rsquo;t know
what I&rsquo;d ever tell her,&rdquo; said Patricia to herself,
as she settled down to work.</p>
<p>An hour later when she went to her room for
a note book, she paused to look out of the window
at the big snowflakes which were floating
lazily down from a partly clouded sky. To her
intense surprise, she saw a man slinking along
the path beside the dormitory, glancing up at
its windows as he passed. A grey hat was
pulled so far down on his head that she could
not get a good look at his face; but his size,
clothing, and general make-up led her to believe
it was Norman Young. Since she had not
turned on her light, it was safe to watch the
man until he crossed the back yard and disappeared
among the trees on Mrs. Brock&rsquo;s lawn.
That practically settled his identity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Catching up the note book from her desk,
she hurried back to the hall. What was Norman
doing out there? Why did he look up at all the
windows? Was there any connection between
his actions and the mysterious telephone call
earlier in the evening? No satisfactory answers
presented themselves; so Patricia tried
to force the troublesome problem out of her
mind by settling to work in real earnest on
the essay.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the sound of a door knob
turning made her jump so violently that she
knocked a big reference book onto the floor.
Mrs. Vincent had opened her door and was
crossing the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m in for it,&rdquo; thought Patricia, stooping
to pick up the heavy volume; but the chaperon
seemed oblivious to the change of girls
at the Black Book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tooth is so bad,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Vincent,
pressing her hand to her right cheek,
&ldquo;that I&rsquo;m going over to my cousin&rsquo;s,&mdash;he&rsquo;s a
dentist,&mdash;to see what he can do for it. I&rsquo;ll be
back as soon as I can.&rdquo; Without waiting for a
reply, she hurried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Patricia, &ldquo;now I certainly
<i>am</i> alone here. The girls on the third floor are
all up at Fine Arts making scenery for the
play; and those from the second are ushering
at the concert&mdash;all except Tiny.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>A little black-haired girl, whose size and
delicate features suggested nothing so much as
a lovely doll, had promptly been nicknamed
by the girls of Arnold Hall. Nobody ever
thought of calling her by her right name,
Evelyn Stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I heard someone say she was
ill. If I get this finished in time, I&rsquo;ll run up
and see her. No, I can&rsquo;t either. I&rsquo;ll have to
stay with the Book and the telephone,&rdquo; thought
Patricia, writing rapidly.</p>
<p>Presently she stopped, sat up straight, and
sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smell smoke!&rdquo; she said aloud, getting up
from the table and walking down the hall.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />A FIRE</h2>
<p>Patricia thrust her head into each room
on her way down the corridor, but no trace of
fire did she find until she reached the very end.
There, in the room occupied by Frances and
Katharine, flames were flickering around the
window frames, apparently coming from outside.
Quickly closing the door again to prevent
a draft, she dashed to the telephone and
called the Fire Department. Then she ran into
her own room to look out of the window and
see how much space the fire covered. The side
of the house below Frances&rsquo; window was
ablaze, and tongues of flame were creeping
steadily up the frame building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tiny&rsquo;s room is directly over Frances&rsquo;!&rdquo;
was the thought which flashed through Patricia&rsquo;s
brain.</p>
<p>Darting back into the hall and up the stairs,
two steps at a time, Patricia burst into Evelyn&rsquo;s
room crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up quickly!&rdquo; She pulled the covers off
of the astonished little girl. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get up; I&rsquo;m too weak!&rdquo; whimpered
Evelyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo; replied Patricia, snatching
up a heavy bathrobe, pulling the girl up from
her pillows, and forcing her arms into the
sleeves. &ldquo;Now come&mdash;<i>quick</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Evelyn hesitated; so Patricia literally
dragged her out of bed, and, grasping her
firmly from behind, pushed the reluctant girl
out to the stairs. There, overcome by fright
and weakness, Evelyn sat down on the top step.
Without wasting any more words, Patricia
grabbed her by the ankles, pulled her all the
way down the long, straight flight of stairs, and
landed her on the rug at the foot of them just
as the fire apparatus clattered up to the house.
Clutching Evelyn under the arms, Patricia
dragged her into the parlor, rolled her onto
some cushions before the fireplace, threw a rug
over her, and ran out to consult with the Fire
Chief who was already in the hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we have to get out?&rdquo; inquired Patricia,
somewhat breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly think so. Seems to be confined to
back corner. Keep all doors closed,&rdquo; was the
man&rsquo;s curt reply, as he directed his assistants
who were bringing in extinguishers and hose.</p>
<p>Immediately a huge crowd assembled and
some policemen were trying to keep the excited
people far enough away from the house; even
the students who lived in the Hall were not
allowed to enter it. Watching from the front
windows of the parlor, Patricia could see the
Alley Gang on the edge of one group; Jane,
calm as usual; Frances crying and holding onto
Katharine; Hazel gesticulating wildly as she
talked to Anne; and the others dodging this
way and that, trying to get closer to the house.
Just as Mrs. Vincent worked her way through
the crowd to speak to one of the firemen, she
came face to face with Clarice and Ivan who
had edged through from the opposite side of
the street. Patricia held her breath for an instant,
but after receiving the fireman&rsquo;s reply
Mrs. Vincent seemed to be chatting quite naturally
with the couple. Probably she did not
realize that they had been out together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>A grey coat and hat in the background caught
Patricia&rsquo;s eye, and as a sudden movement of
their owner brought him fully into the light of
a street lamp, she recognized Norman Young.
Like lightning her mind raced from the skulking
figure beside the dormitory earlier in the
evening, to the subsequent outbreak of fire.
Surely there could be no connection. No doubt
an investigation of the fire would surely follow,
to which, in all probability, she would be summoned.
What should she say? &ldquo;I should hate
to tell a mere suspicion. I&rsquo;m not really certain,&rdquo;
she stated to herself. &ldquo;I wish I knew
what to do about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evelyn, who had lain shivering and weeping
just where Patricia had left her, now raised
up and inquired plaintively: &ldquo;Do you suppose
my room will be burned? I just bought all my
spring clothes; and if they&rsquo;re lost&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure they must be getting the
fire under control; otherwise, they would have
ordered us out,&rdquo; replied Patricia calmly. &ldquo;I
hardly think the flames reached your room
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness!&rdquo; sighed Evelyn, collapsing
again onto her pillows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>Not a word of gratitude to the girl who had
rescued her. People are awfully queer, thought
Patricia, gazing wonderingly at Tiny. Imagine,
thinking of her new clothes when she, herself,
might have been trapped up there, alone and
sick! Turning again to the window, she was
amused to see her Aunt Betsy dash determinedly
through the crowd only to be stopped
by a policeman. Patricia could imagine the
things she was saying to the man who dared
block her way. Nearby stood Ted and John,
scanning the crowd anxiously. She wished she
could in some way attract their attention so
they might know she was safe. Presently the
crowd shifted a little, bringing the two boys
more directly in her range of vision. Ted&rsquo;s restless
eyes soon spied her; he said something to
John, and they both made grotesque gestures,
which she interpreted as offers of rescue. Gaily
she shook her head, thereby causing Ted to shed
imaginary tears into his handkerchief, while
Jack patted him on the back.</p>
<p>Half an hour later sounded the welcome two
gongs which indicated that the fire was out.
Then the crowd made a dash for the front
steps; but a couple of officers, with whom the
Dean had been quietly conferring, took their
stand on the bottom step and refused admittance
to all but Arnold Hall students. Slowly
the townspeople strolled away, while the excited
girls hurried in to see how much damage
had been done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pat!&rdquo; cried Anne, flinging both arms
around her. &ldquo;We were so worried about you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until we caught sight of you at the window,
we were absolutely frantic,&rdquo; added Jane.</p>
<p>A loud burst of laughter from Clarice, who
had just entered with Betty and Hazel, made
them all turn to see what had occasioned it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look at Tiny!&rdquo; cried Clarice. &ldquo;How
did you get down here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Patricia dragged me down!&rdquo; retorted Evelyn
in injured tones. &ldquo;She burst into my room,
scared the life out of me, and literally pulled
me down the stairs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat to the rescue!&rdquo; interrupted Hazel admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our Pat&rsquo;s a heroine!&rdquo; cried Anne, while
the rest of the Gang pressed closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent in the alarm?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Vincent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; acknowledged Patricia modestly. &ldquo;I
smelled smoke and discovered the cause of it
in Katharine&rsquo;s and Frances&rsquo; room&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a double heroine!&rdquo; exulted Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea what started it?&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Vincent sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you all I <i>know</i> about it,&rdquo; replied
Patricia, with a faint accent on the word <i>know</i>,
which was lost on the troubled chaperon. &ldquo;I
was on the Black Book all the evening, except
once when I went to my room for a book and
when I was looking for the fire&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you were dragging me around,&rdquo;
added Tiny, provoking a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Black Book?&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Vincent.
&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your turn. You had it night
before last. Who <i>was</i> supposed to be on it?&rdquo;
looking accusingly around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; admitted Clarice; &ldquo;but I had a
date, so Pat relieved me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re altogether too fond of getting out
of some of your obligations,&rdquo; said Mrs. Vincent
severely, while the girls stared in astonishment
at her rebuking thus publicly the favored
Clarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat didn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; murmured Clarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. Hereafter, if you wish
to relieve one another, you&rsquo;ll have to get my
permission. I want that clearly understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice time we&rsquo;ll have finding her sometimes,
to get permission,&rdquo; murmured Hazel to Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be dreadfully upset, or she&rsquo;d never
lay Clarice out like that,&rdquo; was Anne&rsquo;s comment
to Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be an investigation made,&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Vincent. &ldquo;Dean Walters is very
much disturbed. Morton College has recently
had a regular epidemic of fires of late, all apparently
incendiary; and she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vincent,&rdquo; interrupted Mary, &ldquo;Norman
Young is at the front door and wants to
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chaperon hurried out, and, quite shamelessly,
the girls kept quiet enough to hear what
was said in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brock sent me over to inquire how
much damage had been done, and especially if
anyone was injured,&rdquo; said Norman. &ldquo;If necessary,
she would accommodate three or four of
the girls tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Mrs. Brock that I am very grateful
for her offer,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Vincent, &ldquo;but no
one was harmed; and since the damage was
confined principally to one room, we shall be
able to manage quite nicely without sending
anyone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo; exclaimed Hazel, disappointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you ah-ing for?&rdquo; demanded
Katharine. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be the ones to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lose much of your stuff?&rdquo; asked
Patricia, putting her arm around Frances,
whose face still showed traces of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, girls,&rdquo; ordered Mrs. Vincent, coming
briskly back to the parlor, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get to bed.
Some of you help Evelyn upstairs, and I&rsquo;ll get
bedding to put on the davenport. Katharine
and Frances will have to sleep here until we
can get cleared up a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long time before silence settled down
in the Hall. Even after the lights were out,
and she and Betty had stopped talking, Patricia
lay in her bed as wide awake as if it were noon.
What was she going to say at the investigation?
Suppose Norman Young <i>was</i> the man she had
seen, what possible object could he have had in
setting fire to the Hall? It was certainly bold
of him, in that case, to come and inquire so
coolly about the damages. Yet it didn&rsquo;t seem
as if a perfectly respectable secretary, however
much one might be inclined to dislike him, <i>could</i>
be a fire bug.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>After another hour of restless tossing, she
decided to tell the whole truth if questioned
closely.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />AN INVESTIGATION</h2>
<p>The official bulletin board was located near
the head of the stairs which led down to the
dining room in Horton Hall. Space in front of
it was at a premium after meals; for everybody
was anxious to keep in touch with campus news.
On the day following the fire, an even larger
group of students than usual crowded into the
shallow ell where the board hung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Pat!&rdquo; cried Anne, pointing to the
top notice. &ldquo;The following students are requested
to meet the Dean in her office at two
o&rsquo;clock:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Patricia Randall</p>
<p class="t0">Frances Quinne</p>
<p class="t0">Katharine Weldon&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Patricia read the notice slowly. Although she
knew an investigation would surely be made,
nevertheless her heart sank to her very shoes
when she saw her fears realized quite so soon.
Turning away abruptly, she pushed out of the
crowd and started for the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Anne, who
followed and caught up with her on the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Patricia quickly; &ldquo;or&mdash;that
investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why get all &lsquo;het up&rsquo; over that? Simply
tell what you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s just it; I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; questioned Anne, linking her
arm through that of her friend, and pressing
close to her side. &ldquo;Tell me all about it; you&rsquo;ll
feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I should,&rdquo; began Patricia
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks! What&rsquo;s a friend for? I&rsquo;ll guess
then. You know more about the fire than you
told Dolly?&rdquo; hazarded Anne, watching Patricia
intently. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to admit it; I
can tell just by looking at you. We&rsquo;ll walk
over to the park so no one will interrupt us, and
then you can unburden your mind. I&rsquo;ll bet you
didn&rsquo;t sleep a wink last night. You look like
nobody&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up and down the deserted paths of the little
park they paced briskly, for the wind was cold,
while Patricia told her story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you,&rdquo; said Anne, when Patricia
had finished, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t advance any information;
just answer the Dean&rsquo;s questions. If she
doesn&rsquo;t ask you whether you had any suspicions
who the man was, you&rsquo;ll be all right. In
any case, don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>In spite of the comfort derived from confiding
in Anne, the morning seemed endless to
Patricia, who alternately longed for and
dreaded the arrival of two o&rsquo;clock. Promptly
on the stroke of the hour, the three girls from
Arnold Hall were admitted to Dean Walters&rsquo;
sunny, spacious office. Hardly were they seated
in the chairs given them by Miss Jolly, the
Dean&rsquo;s secretary, when Mrs. Vincent walked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dean will be in in a few minutes,&rdquo;
murmured Miss Jolly, placing another chair
for the latest arrival. As she spoke, the door
to an inner room opened, and a dignified, grey-haired
woman crossed the room briskly to seat
herself behind a large flat-topped desk, facing
her callers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is most distasteful to me,&rdquo; began the
Dean without preamble, &ldquo;to be obliged to question
you regarding last night&rsquo;s catastrophe.
Arson is a serious matter, and you will do much
harm if you try to shield anyone, or by withholding
any detail which might help discover
the culprit. So I ask that you be perfectly
frank with me, and regard what is said in here
as strictly confidential. Mrs. Vincent, I&rsquo;ll hear
first whatever you can tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Nervously the chaperon of Arnold Hall told
the events of her evening, passing rapidly over
the fact that she had left Patricia practically
alone in the house, and dwelling at some length
on her own indisposition. The Dean&rsquo;s face betrayed
no indication of her thoughts, nor did
she make any comment when Mrs. Vincent had
finished her story.</p>
<p>Little chills began to run up and down Patricia&rsquo;s
spine as she awaited her turn next; but
Dean Walters turned slightly in her chair in
order to face Frances more directly, and began
to question her rapidly as to her whereabouts
the previous evening; in what condition she
had left her room; whether she or Katharine
ever smoked there; if her or her room mate&rsquo;s
clothing and belongings were insured, and so
on. Patricia shivered still more as she realized
that the Dean intended to question them rather
than to listen to their stories. Frances was so
frightened that she stumbled and stuttered
through her replies, and finally burst into
nervous tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no reason for you to be so disturbed,
Miss Quinne,&rdquo; said the Dean calmly; &ldquo;I
do not accuse or suspect any one of you; but
I must obtain all the information I possibly
can, not only in order to apprehend the culprit,
if possible, but to satisfy the insurance inspectors.
Miss Weldon, can you add anything
to the facts your room mate has just given
me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dean Walters,&rdquo; replied Katharine
promptly, &ldquo;except that early in the evening as
we were dressing for dinner, our lights kept
jumping, going out and then coming on again,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you try the bulbs to see if they were
screwed in tight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t, because it was late and we
were in a great hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the lights ever acted that way before?&rdquo;
inquired the Dean thoughtfully, resting
her chin in her hand, and fixing her keen
blue eyes on the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A couple of times within the last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not report them?&rdquo; The question
came a bit sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just carelessness, I suppose,&rdquo; admitted
Katharine frankly. &ldquo;We never bother about
things until they are entirely out of commission.
You see we&rsquo;re always just getting back
from somewhere, or going out to something;
so we really don&rsquo;t have much time.&rdquo; Katharine
grinned in a friendly manner at the stern
woman behind the desk; nothing could disturb
or subdue Katharine. Dean Walters made a
few notes on a small pad, then turned to
Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me exactly where you were last night,
and every detail of your evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly and coherently Patricia furnished the
desired information, and then paused, hoping
with all her heart that she would not be questioned
further. False hope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You say you were in your room for a short
time before the fire broke out. Did you notice
anything out of the ordinary then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia flushed up to the roots of her hair,
opened her lips, and then closed them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you did,&rdquo; commented the Dean
quickly. &ldquo;Let me have all the facts, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly Patricia told about the man she
had seen, and his odd actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe him,&rdquo; ordered Dean Walters,
making notes rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see his face,&rdquo; began Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as well as you can, then, with his general
appearance, clothing, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Patricia proceeded, hesitatingly, with the
description, Frances gave a little gasp which,
though immediately suppressed, did not escape
the quick ear of the attentive woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you then, or have you now, any ideas
as to the identity of that man?&rdquo; inquired the
Dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;really&mdash;rather not say,&rdquo; faltered the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither the information nor your part in it
will be made public. I am waiting, Miss Randall,&rdquo;
as poor Patricia still hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked to me like Mr. Young, Mrs.
Brock&rsquo;s secretary; but it doesn&rsquo;t seem possible
for him to be mixed up in such an affair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>A dead silence followed; then Dean Walters
picked up her telephone. &ldquo;Assistant Registrar,
please,&rdquo; she requested curtly, tapping nervously
with her pencil as she waited for the connection.
&ldquo;Mr. Billings? This is Dean Walters.
Please get in touch with Norman Young at once
and send him to my office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke or moved as all tensely awaited
the arrival of the new participant in the inquiry.
In ten minutes Miss Jolly admitted the
blond youth, clad in his customary grey clothes,
and carrying a soft grey hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Mr. Young,&rdquo; directed the Dean,
indicating a chair. &ldquo;We are trying to get some
information regarding last night&rsquo;s fire at
Arnold Hall; and I wondered, since you live
so near to it, if you could add anything to the
facts I already have. I understand you sometimes
cut through the yard to get to Mrs.
Brock&rsquo;s house. Did you happen to do so last
evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; replied the boy frankly, &ldquo;about
half past eight, or maybe nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia trembled. So it <i>had</i> been he. Quietly
she wrapped her coat more closely about her
so no one would notice that she was shaking
violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo; inquired the
Dean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, to work on my assignments for today,&rdquo;
answered Norman, letting his glance
travel along the row of girls at his left. No one
of them, however, met his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice anything unusual about the
dormitory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that it was dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to notice that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The path which is always well lighted from
the windows on that side was so dark that I
involuntarily looked up to see what was the
matter,&rdquo; responded the youth glibly, gazing
directly, and Patricia thought somewhat defiantly,
into the Dean&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you out again that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dean; I went over on an errand&mdash;for
Mrs. Brock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the dormitory yard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when did you return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know the exact time, but it
was after the Fire Department had reached
the Hall; I could not get through the crowd to
go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, then, did Mrs. Brock get in touch with
you to deliver her message to Mrs. Vincent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After watching the firemen for a while, I
went around the block and entered Mrs.
Brock&rsquo;s house just in time to prevent her going
over to the Hall herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you want her to go?&rdquo; demanded
Dean Walters sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she is an old lady, and it was a cold
night for her to be out, and late for her to be
out alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was your &lsquo;errand&rsquo; for Mrs. Brock,
and where did it take you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am not at liberty to disclose; it is
my employer&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; was the decided response.</p>
<p>Dean Walters opened her lips to speak, then
abruptly closed them again. A moment&rsquo;s silence
followed; then, turning toward Mrs. Vincent
and the girls, she said curtly: &ldquo;You may go.
Your testimony was quite satisfactory. Mr.
Young will remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Single file, like Indians, the four women left
the office, descended a short flight of stairs,
passed through a doorway at the foot, and were
out upon the street. Then everybody drew a
long breath of the frosty air and began to
speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it terrible?&rdquo; demanded Frances.
&ldquo;I acted like a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forget it!&rdquo; advised Katharine. &ldquo;You
were nervous; we all were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; contradicted Patricia. &ldquo;I envy
you your poise upon all occasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose the Dean will do
about Norman Young, Mrs. Vincent?&rdquo; asked
Frances.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine she may get in touch with Mrs.
Brock,&rdquo; replied the chaperon somewhat irritably;
for she felt she had not made the best
of impressions upon the Dean. It was advisable
for her to have that lady&rsquo;s goodwill; for
the appointments as chaperon in the various
dormitories were made yearly, and Mrs. Vincent
had reasons of her own for wishing to
remain at Arnold Hall at least two years
longer.</p>
<p>Several days passed, and the girls still gossiped
among themselves about the investigation;
for the officials were strangely silent upon
the subject. No statement had been made
public, and the students were consumed with
curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Vincent,&rdquo; said Katharine one night
when the chaperon came to her room to borrow
a hat, &ldquo;what did the Dean find out about the
fire? We&rsquo;re dying to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that upon the advice of Mrs.
Brock, the whole affair has been dropped,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Vincent, trying on Katharine&rsquo;s
hat before the mirror, her mind more upon
what she was doing than upon what she was
saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth&mdash;&rdquo; began Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more,&rdquo; interrupted the
chaperon quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I should have
told you that much. Don&rsquo;t quote me, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; promised Katharine good-naturedly,
&ldquo;but may I tell the girls without saying
where I got the information? They&rsquo;re all
wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be well to do so; then
maybe they&rsquo;ll drop the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>A couple of weeks later, the Dean announced
in chapel one day that defective wiring had
evidently caused the fire in Arnold Hall, and
asked the girls in all dormitories to be very
careful in their use of electrical appliances.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />UNDER ARREST</h2>
<p>Spring came early that year, and the hills
around Granard were a lovely haze of pale
green. The woods were filled with delicate wild
flowers, and streams which would be mere
threads later in the season, now swollen by
rapid thaws, were tumbling riotously along
their rocky beds. Birds were darting madly
back and forth across the landscape, seeking
mates and places for cozy nests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat,&rdquo; suggested Jack, on one of the warm,
bright days, &ldquo;the spring has gotten into my
blood. Let&rsquo;s cut Shakespeare this afternoon,
and go for a hike in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, you shouldn&rsquo;t tempt me like that!&rdquo;
she cried reprovingly, stopping beside the
bench where they had had their first talk. &ldquo;I
wonder if he&rsquo;ll say anything important in
class.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>The boy laughed at her sudden change of
tone and attitude. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so. He&rsquo;ll
talk on the last act. We know that pretty well,
don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; grinning mischievously down into
the girl&rsquo;s brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a chance anyhow! When shall
we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now. Shall you be warm enough in
that thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That thing!&rsquo; I&rsquo;d have you know this is a
perfectly good leather jacket which my father
gave me for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My error! It&rsquo;s good looking, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fix it up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laughing and joking, as gay as the spring
all around them, they swung briskly along the
state road until they reached Tretton Woods;
then they plunged in among the feathered
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Patricia. &ldquo;Arbutus! The darlings!&rdquo;
Sinking down upon a bed of last year&rsquo;s
leaves, she tenderly plucked a couple of sprays.
&ldquo;It always seems a pity to tear up a whole lot
of it,&rdquo; she observed, handing one piece to Jack,
and fastening the other in her own buttonhole.</p>
<p>A little deeper in the woods they came upon
a merry little stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Pat,&rdquo; exulted Jack, &ldquo;at that brook.
Let&rsquo;s make a dam&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a lake?&rdquo; concluded Patricia, eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Like two children they worked happily until
a wide pond spread out in a fern bordered
hollow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that lovely?&rdquo; rejoiced Patricia, gazing
proudly at the result of their labor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is! Gosh, Pat, look!&rdquo; holding out
his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half past five? It <i>can&rsquo;t</i> be. How I wish
now I&rsquo;d brought the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, young lady!&rdquo; contradicted
Jack masterfully. &ldquo;A hike&rsquo;s made on two feet,
not on four wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be late for dinner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll take you somewhere to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like this?&rdquo; looking down at her soiled
hands and muddy skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way out of the woods, Patricia&rsquo;s attention
was caught by a cluster of cup-like
white flowers. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t those pretty, Jack?
Let&rsquo;s take them home as a souvenir. We&rsquo;ve lost
our arbutus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both stooped to gather a handful as quickly
as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the nasty things!&rdquo; cried Patricia.
&ldquo;Their stems are just full of red juice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks for all the world like blood,&rdquo; commented
the boy, dropping his flowers into the
stream, which quickly whirled them away, and
wiping his hands on his handkerchief. Patricia
followed his example.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful stuff to get off,&rdquo; complained
Patricia, still rubbing her hands vigorously, as
they stepped out upon the state road almost
under the wheels of a motorcycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Heavens, girl! Watch your step. That
was a narrow shave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say it was. Why, it&rsquo;s coming back,&rdquo;
added Patricia, as the car wheeled about and
approached them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re troopers,&rdquo; breathed Jack, as the
car stopped beside them.</p>
<p>Two young men gazed searchingly at the two
disheveled figures before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you been doing?&rdquo; demanded the
man in the side car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gathering wild flowers in the woods,&rdquo; replied
the girl promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where are they?&rdquo; asked the other
trooper, fixing his eyes on the red-stained
handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some we lost, and some we threw away,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me those handkerchiefs,&rdquo; ordered the
red-haired trooper, hopping nimbly out of the
side car.</p>
<p>In speechless astonishment the hikers handed
the crumpled rags to the man, who took them
to the driver of the motorcycle, and both
troopers examined them carefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Blood, without a doubt,&rdquo; stated the auburn-haired
man. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ve made our catch.
They certainly answer to the description of
Crack Mayne and his pal, Angel. You&rsquo;re under
arrest,&rdquo; he continued, turning toward the
couple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What utter nonsense!&rdquo; exploded Jack angrily,
but Patricia laid her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got those stains from flower stems,&rdquo;
she stated calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to show us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we picked them all, and when we
found that our hands were stained we threw
the flowers away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah? Where did you throw them?&rdquo;
asked the driver, getting off and starting towards
the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone down the stream,&rdquo; giggled
Patricia, her sense of humor unwisely getting
the upper hand.</p>
<p>In later days, when Jack wanted to tease her,
he always said that Patricia&rsquo;s giggle sealed
their fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite clear they&rsquo;ve been up to something,&rdquo;
muttered the red-haired trooper; &ldquo;maybe a
murder. You take &rsquo;em in, and I&rsquo;ll poke about
in there to see what I can find. Send Murphy
out for me as soon as you get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia and Jack were hustled into the side
car, and rushed off toward town. Soon Jack
took from his pocket a pencil and an envelope.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Better give middle names at the station,&rdquo;
he scribbled rather illegibly, due to the motion
of the car. &ldquo;Keep college out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia nodded; then Jack tore the envelope
into little pieces, which the wind eagerly
snatched from his hand and bore away.</p>
<p>At the station, they registered as Peter Dunn
and Alice Randall. The stained handkerchiefs
were laid aside for expert examination, and
the charges recorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now may we go?&rdquo; asked Jack, with elaborate
innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sure,&rdquo; replied the sergeant sarcastically.
&ldquo;Just walk right out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Mac,&rdquo; drawled an exceedingly tall,
solemn-looking youth, letting the street door
close with a bang. &ldquo;What have you for me
tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a couple of&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>The newcomer took one look at the pair;
then announced without a trace of surprise:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Jack Dunn, the football player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twin cousin,&rdquo; corrected Jack gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen cousins who looked
just alike?&rdquo; inquired Jack, raising his eyebrows
in astonishment. &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be, but I didn&rsquo;t see you on the
field and off of it last fall for nothing. What&rsquo;s
the racket?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Before Jack could reply, the sergeant irritably
gave the desired information, the last of
which was drowned by a bark of laughter from
the human bean pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is rich! This is just too rich!&rdquo; he
chortled. &ldquo;Brave troopers arrest couple of
college students for gathering bloodroot. Oh!
Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what it was!&rdquo; exclaimed Patricia.
&ldquo;I should have known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a reporter,&rdquo; said Jack accusingly.
&ldquo;For the love of Pete don&rsquo;t put us in the
paper. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen, Bozo,&rdquo; interrupted Craig Denton,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t kid yourself that nobody will know
this story unless he reads it in the paper. One
of your own fellows stopped in at the office
before I came over here to say that a couple
of college students had just been taken into the
police station. That&rsquo;s how I happened to
breeze in so early, Mac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he look like?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big blond; jaw sticks out like this; little
bits of eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; breathed Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the devil did he get hold of it?&rdquo; exploded
Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Saw you brought in,&rdquo; replied Craig, as he
held the door open for them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking these
birds home, Mac,&rdquo; he called to the sergeant.
&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he continued, as they were out
on the street, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better let us present the
story truthfully. It&rsquo;s the best way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; replied Jack, ruefully, &ldquo;you
have us at your mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did the troopers look like?&rdquo; asked
Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t describe them,&rdquo; declared Jack
emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; agreed Patricia. &ldquo;We were too
much upset to notice details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; mused the newspaper man,
glancing from one to the other suspiciously;
but both met his eyes with well simulated
innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going somewhere to eat,&rdquo; announced
Jack; &ldquo;better come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we surely owe you something for your
kind rescue,&rdquo; laughed Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old saying about two being company,&rdquo;
began Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Come along!&rdquo; cried Jack, who
had taken a liking to the grave youth with his
keen sense of humor. &ldquo;Where shall we go,
Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wherever we won&rsquo;t meet anybody we know.
We&rsquo;re both sketches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder we were regarded as suspicious
characters,&rdquo; agreed Jack. &ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better
go downtown. Where&rsquo;s a good place?&rdquo; turning
to the reporter. &ldquo;We usually eat up on the
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Exeter, on Field Street, is good. Got
stalls; you wouldn&rsquo;t be conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exeter for us,&rdquo; decided Patricia; &ldquo;and
let&rsquo;s hurry. I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a good dinner, accompanied by much
joking and laughter, Jack escorted Patricia up
toward College Hill, while Craig hurried back
to the office of the <i>Granard Herald</i>, after promising
to spare the principals as much as possible
in his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little did we think this noon what we were
in for,&rdquo; said Jack, as he was about to leave
Patricia at the entrance of Arnold Hall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry to have gotten you into such a jam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; protested the girl. &ldquo;Why, it was all
my fault. If I hadn&rsquo;t picked those flowers&mdash;bloodroot&rsquo;s
certainly the right name for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I hadn&rsquo;t urged you to cut&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, we had a good time; and, as for
the unpleasant part, well, it didn&rsquo;t last long.
And it was an unusual experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not over yet; all the publicity, and
talk. Of course, I could stand it; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; finished Patricia
with a flash of anger in eyes and voice. &ldquo;I always
try to be a good sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are; and I didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&rdquo; faltered
Jack, distressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Patricia, her anger gone in
a minute as she saw that he was really disturbed.
&ldquo;Everybody will laugh and joke about
it for a while, and then&mdash;pouf! It&rsquo;s all out,
just like a candle. Nothing lasts very long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about our benefactors&rsquo; opinion of the
affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances, he or she ought
to take a sane view of the matter. We have
done nothing of which we should be ashamed.
Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Patricia ran up the steps,
and Jack strolled to the Frat House thinking
what a sensible girl Patricia was, and what a
good pal.</p>
<p>A most amusing account of their escapade
came out in the morning&rsquo;s paper, and the college
world rocked with merriment. Patricia
and Jack were bombarded with jokes, questions,
congratulations, and cartoons.</p>
<p>The next day Jack and Patricia met on the
stairs leading to their Shakespeare classroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a queer note,&rdquo; began Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did yours say?&rdquo; asked Patricia
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep out of police stations in the future.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did mine; but, some way, it didn&rsquo;t seem
cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you tell that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but I just felt that whoever
sent the note was smiling as he wrote it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have a wonderful imagination, Pat,&rdquo;
said Jack, grinning down at her. &ldquo;I only hope
it&rsquo;s a reliable one.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />A PICNIC</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Could I hire any of you ladies to swim
for me next Tuesday?&rdquo; inquired Clarice, popping
out of the back door and perching on the
porch railing.</p>
<p>It was Saturday morning. Patricia, Anne,
Frances, Katharine, and Betty had washed
their hair, and were strung along the sunny top
steps drying it, preparatory to going to town
for a wave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us were keen enough about that
swimming exam to be looking for chances to
try it twice,&rdquo; replied Katharine decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought not to mind it,&rdquo; drawled Anne
sleepily; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a regular mer&mdash;maid,&rdquo; her
last word cut short by a huge yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Anne,&rdquo; cried Frances, grabbing
her by the shoulders, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be sound asleep
in a minute and roll down the steps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this strong sunlight,&rdquo; said Anne, leaning
comfortably back against Frances&rsquo; knees,
and closing her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you doing your own
swimming?&rdquo; asked Betty, glancing up at
Clarice through a tangle of brown hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t know enough about it,&rdquo; replied
the girl nonchalantly, swinging one foot.
&ldquo;I hate it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that you&rsquo;ve been in
gym class all this year, and don&rsquo;t know yet how
to swim?&rdquo; inquired Katharine bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think Professor Wilson would
have killed you off long ago,&rdquo; remarked
Frances. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s such an irritable creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Clarice, &ldquo;and also so near-sighted
that he doesn&rsquo;t know half the time
who&rsquo;s in the pool and who&rsquo;s out of it. Haven&rsquo;t
you noticed how dependent he is on his class
books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then can&rsquo;t you take a chance on his being
too near-sighted to see that you can&rsquo;t swim?&rdquo;
asked Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck! All women may look alike
to him, but not all strokes in swimming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you manage all term?&rdquo; inquired
Patricia, shaking her yellow mop of hair vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he was always hollering at me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>There were two divisions of the Sophomore
Gymnasium class. Clarice was in the second,
while all the rest of the Alley Gang were in
the first. To be able to swim was absolutely
necessary for promotion to the Junior class
at the end of the year, and the second week
in May had been assigned for the final tests.
Professor Wilson, a critical, quick-tempered
little man, was an excellent teacher, but he did
not like women and never bothered to get acquainted
with the individual members of his
classes, which did not at all add to his
popularity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I can swim out of doors by myself, I
think I shall like it,&rdquo; commented Anne, &ldquo;but
not while Professor Wilson dances around the
rim of the pool snapping like a turtle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I feel about it,&rdquo; agreed
Patricia. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we go out to Green Lake
some Saturday and try our skill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go next Saturday,&rdquo; proposed Katharine
enthusiastically. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in the morning,
and have a roast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Us and the rest of the Gang. Everybody
willing, hold up the left foot,&rdquo; directed Katharine.</p>
<p>A laughing scramble ensued during which
Clarice nearly fell off the railing. When they
had settled back into their former positions,
Patricia suggested hesitatingly, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take
Rhoda. She&rsquo;s so very nice to all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; agreed Katharine promptly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But who&rsquo;d take her place?&rdquo; questioned
Betty doubtfully. &ldquo;Could she get off for the
whole day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. That day she was ill, Sue Mason
subbed for her; and she probably would again.
Sue doesn&rsquo;t have many dates,&rdquo; said Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could invite her, too, then,&rdquo; said
Patricia slowly. &ldquo;It must be pretty lonely to
be among so many girls, and not be in on their
good times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, but you can&rsquo;t start asking people
from upstairs,&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;If you do,
there&rsquo;ll be no stopping place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Sue, anyhow?&rdquo;
asked Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly her queer ways,&rdquo; replied Clarice
quickly. &ldquo;Last year she was always rapping
on people&rsquo;s doors and asking them to keep
quiet so she could study. Then she complained
to the Dean every so often about how long
some of the girls kept her out of the bathroom.
She also felt it her duty to report the maid
several times for being late in distributing the
clean linen. In short, Sue just disapproved of
the way everything was run, and got herself in
most awfully wrong. She belongs in some
boarding house, not in a dorm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she happen to come back here,
since she found so much fault with the place?&rdquo;
inquired Patricia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Maybe she found out that she
liked it after all. Hasn&rsquo;t opened her mouth this
year, so the girls upstairs say; but she queered
herself for good and all last year,&rdquo; replied
Clarice carelessly. &ldquo;But to return to my original
question, can&rsquo;t I interest any of you in
helping me out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we could do,&rdquo; began
Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go into the pool for me when my name is
called,&rdquo; answered Clarice boldly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
ten in it for anybody who will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re surely not in earnest,&rdquo; said Patricia,
pushing back her hair to look directly
at the girl on the railing above her. Patricia
was so easily embarrassed for others,
frequently an embarrassment in which the
&ldquo;others&rdquo; took no part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo; retorted Clarice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Clarice!&rdquo; cried Frances reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it if you <i>are</i> shocked. If it were
as necessary for any of you to be graduated
from this institution as it is for me, you&rsquo;d go
the limit, too!&rdquo; Clarice&rsquo;s tone was defiant, but
as she slid off of the railing and hurried into
the house, Patricia who was still watching her
saw sudden tears fill the girl&rsquo;s hard, black eyes.</p>
<p>Anne shrugged her shoulders as the back
door banged. Frances raised her eyebrows and
looked troubled. Betty and Katharine nonchalantly
continued the business of hair drying.
Patricia sighed&mdash;&ldquo;I wish we could help her
out,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully. &ldquo;I know a little
of what graduation means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then why doesn&rsquo;t she work?&rdquo; demanded
Betty sharply.</p>
<p>No one was able to answer that question, so
after a moment they began to discuss plans
for the picnic. In the meantime a girl who had
been sitting quietly at an open window above
the back porch left her room and went in search
of Clarice.</p>
<p class="tb">By four o&rsquo;clock on Tuesday afternoon, the
swimming tests were over and the gym was
filled with chattering girls discussing the probabilities
of success and failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t draw a full breath until I see the
list posted,&rdquo; declared Frances, as she left the
building with Anne and Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine we all passed,&rdquo; observed Anne
placidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I knew how poor Clarice came out,&rdquo;
said Patricia. &ldquo;Yet I hate to ask her right
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t heard her mention the subject
since Saturday morning,&rdquo; said Frances. &ldquo;Have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both girls shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she took some time to practice, and
managed to pull through,&rdquo; suggested Anne.
&ldquo;Clarice can do almost anything <i>if</i> she tries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I truly hope so,&rdquo; said Patricia fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>That evening the Alley Gang was in such a
furore over arrangements for the picnic that
the test was not even mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the water going to be awfully cold so
early in the season?&rdquo; objected Jane, when the
question of &ldquo;eats&rdquo; had been satisfactorily settled,
and that of bathing was under discussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the day is fairly warm, and we go in
where it&rsquo;s sunny, I think it will be all right,&rdquo;
replied Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right for an out-door girl like you,&rdquo; retorted
Betty, with a shiver, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t
sound altogether attractive to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then stay out of it,&rdquo; advised Katharine
sensibly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; anybody who doesn&rsquo;t want to go in
can get busy around the fireplace and have a
big feed all ready for us. We&rsquo;ll be starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw you when you weren&rsquo;t, France,&rdquo;
called Clarice, who just then appeared in the
doorway of Jane&rsquo;s room where the girls had
congregated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know anybody who runs up to the Varsity
Shoppe any oftener than you do?&rdquo; retorted
Frances quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quarrel, children,&rdquo; admonished Jane.
&ldquo;We can all do our share when it comes to
eating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; inquired Anne, &ldquo;what did
Rhoda say when you asked her? Will she go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t quite sure,&rdquo; replied Patricia,
&ldquo;but will let us know on Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; interrupted Frances, leaning forward
to look at Patricia, &ldquo;does anybody know
why she goes over to Mrs. Brock&rsquo;s early in the
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia glanced at Jane and Ruth before she
replied with a laugh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know she <i>does</i> go?&rdquo; demanded
Lucile quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw her, this very morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were <i>you</i> doing, awake before the
bell rang?&rdquo; inquired Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My shade was flapping; and if there&rsquo;s anything
I can&rsquo;t stand, it&rsquo;s a flapping shade. I got
up to fix it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was it?&rdquo; queried Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dreamed it,&rdquo; jeered Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did <i>not</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe she was just coming home from a
party,&rdquo; suggested Mary&rsquo;s mild voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her one morning, too,&rdquo; admitted
Hazel. &ldquo;I got up at five to study, wrapped a
blanket around me, and was curled up in a
chair beside the window cramming French
verbs&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know that you were asleep, too,&rdquo;
interrupted Lucile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw Rhoda,&rdquo; continued Hazel,
throwing a pillow at Lucile, &ldquo;she was coming
out of the back door of Big House. When she
passed our window, I said &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; and she
jumped a foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing; she just glanced up, put her finger
on her lips, and hurried into the Hall. She is
always so smiling and good-natured, but she
didn&rsquo;t look at all pleased to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she get in without ringing the
bell?&rdquo; inquired Clarice eagerly.</p>
<p>Everybody laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That interests you most, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; inquired
Lucile sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went around to the laundry door,&rdquo; explained
Hazel. &ldquo;I think she has a key for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an idea!&rdquo; cried Clarice. &ldquo;Why
can&rsquo;t we borrow that key some night when we
want to go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four stone steps led down from the path on
the east side of the dormitory to a small door
which opened directly into the laundry, located
under Frances&rsquo; and Katharine&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And spend the rest of the night in the laundry?&rdquo;
exclaimed Hazel. &ldquo;An ironing board for
a bed doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not come up?&rdquo; inquired Anne idly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, darling, Dolly herself locks that
door at the head of the stairs on her eleven
o&rsquo;clock round every night,&rdquo; replied Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t see how Rhoda gets up,&rdquo; said
Frances, frowning in perplexity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother Rhoda!&rdquo; cried Hazel impatiently.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s plan how we&rsquo;re all of us and
our luggage going to get out to Green Lake
and back, when we&rsquo;ve only two cars available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat and I can take the eats and a couple
of girls to guard them, and then come back for
the rest of you,&rdquo; proposed Mary, who owned
the only other car in the Gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good idea,&rdquo; approved Anne; and
so the matter was settled.</p>
<p class="tb">Saturday proved to be one of those warm,
sunny days which often usher in an early
summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that haze on the hills?&rdquo; said Katharine,
as they were packing the cars in the
driveway. &ldquo;That means heat. We&rsquo;ll be able
to swim after all. Isn&rsquo;t it fine that we all passed
the test, even Clarice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t look much like a picnic at this time
yesterday,&rdquo; observed Patricia with a shiver at
the recollection. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it a cold, dismal
day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure was! Who&rsquo;s going on this load?&rdquo;
inquired Anne, turning to the girls who were
bossing the job of loading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Katharine and Frances will go with Pat,&rdquo;
responded Jane, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll keep Mary company.
Don&rsquo;t any of the rest of you wander off and
have us hunting all over for you when we come
back. All aboard who&rsquo;s going aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>By eleven o&rsquo;clock the whole Gang, including
Rhoda, was swarming over the picnic grounds
situated on a wooded hill overlooking Green
Lake, an oblong body of very deep water. At
one end, the lake was bordered by flat, treeless
meadows, and the low shore line provided a
fairly good sandy beach. At the other end,
heavily wooded land sloped down to the water
on all sides, giving it a gloomy, deep green cast.
A rough path followed the irregular stretch of
water on the east side, and wound on up the
hill into the woods where a depression between
two steep slopes formed a small picnic ground.
The few tables, benches, and stone ovens which
occupied the space were unclaimed today; so
the girls had their choice. They decided on a
table from which they could look through an
opening in the trees, directly down onto the
still, green water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swim first,&rdquo; announced Katharine, after
the food had been placed upon one table, and
the extra wraps upon another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will our things be safe here alone?&rdquo; inquired
Betty doubtfully, when they were ready
to go down to the lower end of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay with it,&rdquo; offered Rhoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; protested Anne. &ldquo;Come on down
with us and swim.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t swim,&rdquo; replied Rhoda, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
care for bathing. I brought a book along, and
I&rsquo;d just as soon as not stay here and read until
you come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing that the maid really meant what she
said, Anne followed the rest of the girls who
were already half way down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Rhoda?&rdquo; asked Patricia, looking
around, when they reached the beach and were
about to dive into the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think she&rsquo;d like at least to come
and watch us,&rdquo; said Patricia, when Anne had
explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up after a while and bring
her down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swimming in the open was very different
from swimming in a tank, and after fifteen
minutes of strenuous exercise the girls came
out to lie on the sand in the warm sun for a
little rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lend me your cloak, Anne,&rdquo; requested Patricia,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll run up for Rhoda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; replied Anne,
handing Patricia her woolly bath cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make her. The things will be all right.
There isn&rsquo;t a soul here today, except us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrapping the cape closely around her, Patricia
started briskly along the path toward the
picnic grounds. Rhoda was sitting on a big
stone, half way down one of the sloping sides
of the depression, in a pool of sunlight which
some broken branches let through. So deeply
interested was she in her book, that she did not
see Patricia until the girl stood right in front
of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I came back to get you,&rdquo; panted Patricia.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t like to have you up here all by yourself.
That&rsquo;s no fun. Come on!&rdquo; taking the
book out of the maid&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; began Rhoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we do,&rdquo; Patricia cut her short, putting
out both hands to help her up from the stone.</p>
<p>Laughing a little in protest, Rhoda got up
and the two started down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s Clarice,&rdquo; said Patricia, stopping
short in surprise, as she caught sight of
the girl, swinging carelessly along beside the
lake just below them. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s all dressed. I
thought she was with the rest of the crowd.
I wonder what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s too near the ragged edge,&rdquo; exclaimed
Rhoda sharply.</p>
<p>Hearing voices, Clarice looked up without
checking her pace. Her foot struck a hole in
the bank beside the path, and with a cry she
slid down into the lake. Dropping Anne&rsquo;s
cloak, Patricia dashed down the hill and dove
into the water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>A treacherous current had immediately
swept Clarice away from the bank and was
bearing her out toward the center of the lake.
&ldquo;No use to call for help,&rdquo; thought Patricia;
&ldquo;the rest of the girls are too far away. Lucky
that Clarice learned to swim after all; for she&rsquo;ll
be able to help herself a little. She&rsquo;s gone
down!&rdquo; Striking out frantically, with legs and
arms, Patricia made what speed she could
toward the place where she had seen Clarice
disappear. Fear and necessity gave her extra
strength and speed, so that she was near enough
to Clarice when the girl came up to seize her by
the collar of her sweater.</p>
<p>With the irresistible inclination of a drowning
person, Clarice tried to throw her arms
around Patricia, who knew that meant disaster
for both of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Swim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; moaned Clarice, frantic with fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to! We&rsquo;ll both drown if you
don&rsquo;t. Put your hand on my shoulder and strike
out as I do. If you try to grab me around the
neck, I&rsquo;ll leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarice pulled herself together and tried to
obey. It seemed to Patricia as if they made no
progress at all, so weighed down was she with
Clarice&rsquo;s weight. Just one more stroke, she
said to herself, when it seemed as if she could
go no farther. Now one more. That wasn&rsquo;t so
bad. Now another. Encouraging herself, straining
each muscle to the utmost, she at last
reached the bank where Rhoda stood with one
arm wound around the tree trunk and the other extended to
<a id="rfront" href="#front">help them scramble up the rough stones, slippery with moss.</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>As soon as they were safe again, Clarice
threw herself flat on the ground and burst into
a violent fit of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let her cry,&rdquo; advised Rhoda, as Patricia
bent over the sobbing girl. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll get over the
shock more quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll take cold,&rdquo; objected Patricia,
throwing Anne&rsquo;s cloak over the prone figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will you,&rdquo; added Rhoda, removing
her own coat, preparatory to wrapping it
around the shivering girl beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep that. I&rsquo;ll get my own,&rdquo; protested
Patricia, running up the hill to where the wraps
were piled on one of the tables. Pulling her
long brown coat from under several others, she
wrapped it around her and returned to Clarice
and Rhoda.</p>
<p>The former was still weeping with her face
hidden in a bed of ferns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice, get up!&rdquo; ordered Patricia sternly.
&ldquo;No sense in having pneumonia just because
you won&rsquo;t control yourself. Get up, I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking her firmly by the arms, with Rhoda&rsquo;s
help she raised the girl and wrapped Anne&rsquo;s
cape more closely around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a judgment on me!&rdquo; quavered poor
Clarice, as they led her up the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a judgment?&rdquo; demanded Patricia
rather sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being drowned because I cheated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t drowned,&rdquo; objected Patricia,
laughing in spite of herself. Clarice was
such a child!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have been, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
you. I&rsquo;ll never cheat again; I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How and when and where did you cheat?&rdquo;
inquired Patricia, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swimming test. A girl from upstairs went
in when my name was called, passed, and Professor
Wilson never knew the difference. She&rsquo;s
about my size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia was speechless. What should one say
under such circumstances? She shrank from
the holier-than-thou attitude; yet to remain
quiet might be taken as approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do about dry clothing for her,
Miss Randall?&rdquo; inquired Rhoda, saving the
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Patricia in a worried
tone. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better drive her home
to get some. It won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather <i>stay</i> home, if you don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo;
said Clarice, drying her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, because.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just as well if she&rsquo;d take a hot
bath and go right to bed,&rdquo; advised Rhoda.
&ldquo;Shall I come, too, to help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Clarice quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll do as Rhoda suggests?&rdquo; asked
Patricia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Clarice nodded and went toward Patricia&rsquo;s
car, while Patricia said to Rhoda in a low tone:
&ldquo;If any of the girls come back while I&rsquo;m gone,
tell them Clarice didn&rsquo;t feel very well and I
took her home. No point in letting them in on
poor Clarice&rsquo;s story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,&rdquo; agreed Rhoda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patricia,&rdquo; said Clarice, when they were on
their way out of the parking section, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know how to thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about it. I&rsquo;m glad I happened
to be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I tell about the test?&rdquo; inquired
Clarice slowly after being silent for several
minutes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind to learn to
swim before college closes for the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Then under those circumstances,
you&rsquo;ll be getting your promotion fairly; and it
seems to me that any revelation of your&mdash;your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cheating,&rdquo; supplied Clarice frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would involve too many people. You see,
Professor Wilson&rsquo;s near-sightedness would be
revealed, and perhaps cause his dismissal; the
girl who subbed for you would be drawn into
it, and probably get into trouble&mdash;perhaps even
be dropped; then the girls in your section who
know about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We were called out of the dressing room
one at a time, according to numbered cards;
and nobody paid any attention to who was out.
It&rsquo;s such a large section.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Well, anyhow, since you&rsquo;re going to
correct the wrong, as far as possible, I can&rsquo;t
see any object in broadcasting the story. That
reminds me, I asked Rhoda to tell the girls
that you didn&rsquo;t feel very well and I had taken
you home. So the three of us will keep our
own counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat, you&rsquo;re just the best sport I ever
knew!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Clarice?&rdquo; inquired
Hazel, an hour later, as they all sat around the
table disposing of steak, potatoes, sugared
buns, fried cakes, and coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a chill,&rdquo; replied Patricia calmly,
opening a box of marshmallows; &ldquo;but she attended
to it in time, so I think she&rsquo;ll be all
right tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subsequent devotion of the black sheep
to swimming aroused much comment among
the members of the Alley Gang. Many were
the theories advanced, but the girl kept her own
secret and worked doggedly until she was as
proficient as most of her companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />A ROBBERY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the paper this morning?&rdquo;
demanded Jane excitedly, waving the <i>Granard
Herald</i> overhead as Pat was hurrying down
the corridor to her room after breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Jane held out the front sheet and
pointed to a headline in heavy print:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Daring Robbery. Thieves Make Big Haul.</span></p>
<p>Victim of losses sits in library while
men work in room above. No clews.
Mrs. Brock, owner of property, offers
reward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; gasped Patricia. &ldquo;How awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A clock somewhere in the Hall struck the
quarter hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going to be late,&rdquo; cried Patricia,
dashing into her room, seizing a couple of
books, and running down the corridor. &ldquo;Have
to hear the rest later,&rdquo; she called back to Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat!&rdquo; cried Anne, catching hold of her at
the door. &ldquo;Have you seen the paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jane just showed it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it exciting? All her jewelry, and a
lot of money taken.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m late, Anne; let me go, please!&rdquo; pulling
away from the girl.</p>
<p>At the corner of Wentworth Street, Ruth
caught up with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard the news?&rdquo; she panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but can&rsquo;t stop; most time for class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Patricia sank, breathless, into a seat in
French class, which had already begun, Frances
leaned forward from the row behind to whisper,
&ldquo;Know about the robbery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper says nobody heard a thing,&rdquo;
continued Frances. &ldquo;Norman was in his room
right next to the one where the robbers were
working. Isn&rsquo;t that thrilling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; traced Patricia&rsquo;s pencil
on the margin of her note book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice met him this morning, and he told
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Quinne, <i>continuez s&rsquo;il vous
plait</i>,&rdquo; requested the Professor&rsquo;s smooth voice.</p>
<p>It must be confessed that Patricia heard
little of the French lesson that day. Her mind
was briskly working on the piecemeal information
she had received about the disaster at
Big House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems awfully queer,&rdquo; she commented to
Jack later in the day, &ldquo;that a person or persons
would break into a house early in the evening
like that. Why, Mrs. Brock or Norman
might have walked in on them any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Jack smiled. &ldquo;He probably had worked out,
by direct observation, when his chances of being
undisturbed were greatest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Direct observation?&rdquo; repeated Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; whoever it was knew the layout of
the house, the habits of its inmates, and where
valuables were kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack!&rdquo; cried Patricia, her eyes dilating
with a dawning suspicion. &ldquo;Who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not put anything into words, Pat,&rdquo;
Jack said quickly; &ldquo;probably we&rsquo;re all wrong.
I hope so. Let&rsquo;s try to forget all about it. The
authorities will take care of it; it&rsquo;s their business,
not ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of Jack&rsquo;s good advice, Patricia could
not keep from dwelling on the subject rather
constantly for the rest of the week, especially
since the robbery was the Gang&rsquo;s principal
theme of conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brock,&rdquo; announced Katharine on
Thursday night, &ldquo;is offering a large reward
for the return of her grandfather&rsquo;s watch
alone. It&rsquo;s a valuable heirloom, and she cares
more for that than for the rest of the jewelry.
Don&rsquo;t I wish I could go out some morning, pick
up the timepiece, and take it over to her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess none of us would object to some
extra money,&rdquo; laughed Anne. &ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t
going home this week end, Pat, we might organize
a searching party and beat Kath out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, anyway,&rdquo; advised Patricia, pulling
out her bag and beginning to pack it ready
for an early start the next afternoon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
better get your things together, Jane; we won&rsquo;t
have any time after lunch tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane going with you?&rdquo; inquired Anne
somewhat wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Want to come, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Do</i> I! You&rsquo;re a peach.&rdquo; Anne hugged Patricia,
and departed for her own room, stumbling
over the doorstop as she went out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Anne; you&rsquo;ll break your neck
over my coach-and-four,&rdquo; called Patricia. &ldquo;She
never fails to fall over that,&rdquo; she added to the
girls. &ldquo;Kath, why don&rsquo;t you come with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to, but what will your mother say
to so many of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t care. My room has twin beds,
so I can have guests in comfort whenever I
want to; and then we have the regular guest
room. You won&rsquo;t have to sleep on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I&rsquo;d care for that! I&rsquo;ve done it at house
parties.&rdquo; Katharine departed to announce her
good fortune to the rest of the Gang, and then
went to pack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I envy you, Patricia,&rdquo; said Jane, the next
afternoon, as they were riding through a
stretch of woods, &ldquo;being able to take this lovely
ride home any week end you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not whenever I want to,&rdquo; corrected Pat,
&ldquo;but rather when I have money enough for the
gas, and when my work can be left for a couple
of days. I can&rsquo;t do any studying at home, of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d care for these woods in the
dark,&rdquo; observed Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, darling,&rdquo; said Katharine soothingly,
&ldquo;you won&rsquo;t be in them in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance,&rdquo; agreed Patricia. &ldquo;Dad always
starts me back in good time so I won&rsquo;t be
on the road after nightfall. He&rsquo;s deadly afraid
of a hold-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good place for wild flowers, I should
think,&rdquo; continued Jane, peering in between the
tree trunks. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to stop and
gather some, Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not! I&rsquo;ve had quite enough experience
with wild flowers for a while, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever see your reporter-rescuer?&rdquo; asked
Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once in a while. Jack likes him a lot, and
Craig has asked us out a couple of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he a girl friend?&rdquo; demanded Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not; not a regular, anyhow. But
why should you be interested? Aren&rsquo;t you and
the Professor good pals any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure; but there are several nice girls in the
Gang who haven&rsquo;t boy friends. You see I&rsquo;m
being purely altruistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the man in question would prefer to
manage his affairs himself,&rdquo; said Jane practically.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe; in fact, he may have made a selection
already,&rdquo; suggested Anne, smiling at Pat
in the mirror.</p>
<p>Patricia kept her eyes on the road ahead,
and feigned ignorance of Anne&rsquo;s meaning.
Presently she changed the subject by asking
what her guests would like to do that evening.
&ldquo;The week end is so short that we have to use
every minute of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A movie,&rdquo; proposed Katharine. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
seen a good one in a coon&rsquo;s age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And double sodas all around afterward,&rdquo;
added Jane. &ldquo;My treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds good to me,&rdquo; agreed Anne, when
Patricia looked inquiringly at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do. Guess
I&rsquo;ll put on a little speed, so we&rsquo;ll get home early
enough to go to the first performance. This
new road certainly has meant a lot to me&mdash;it
shortened the distance so much. You know it&rsquo;s
quite a trip by rail; this road through the
woods cuts off miles. Oh!&rdquo; her remarks concluded
with a shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; demanded Anne,
startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bee!&rdquo; exclaimed Patricia. &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s
sake keep your eyes on him and try to put him
out. I&rsquo;m always afraid of being stung when
I&rsquo;m at the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have some opinion of our eyes if you
think they are capable of putting out a full
grown bee,&rdquo; remarked Katharine. &ldquo;Mine don&rsquo;t
even see him, to say nothing of pushing him
out the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop joking,&rdquo; begged Patricia, &ldquo;and find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; cried Anne, drawing herself
as far into the corner as she could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; demanded Jane, turning around
to look at the passengers in the back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down on the floor,&rdquo; said Katharine. &ldquo;You
girls make me tired; all so afraid of one poor
little bee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you pick him up and throw him
out, if there&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of,&rdquo; suggested
Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o; but, there! I&rsquo;ve set my bag on him.
He&rsquo;ll be quite dead in a minute, then I&rsquo;ll pick
him up,&rdquo; offered Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most any one of us would be willing to pick
up a dead bee,&rdquo; offered Jane.</p>
<p>Presently Katharine lifted the bag; but the
action was followed by a squeal from Anne,
who announced that he was just as much alive
as ever.</p>
<p>Katharine thumped her bag down again
while Jane laughed breathlessly.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Katharine again peered
at her victim; and again he showed very definite
signs of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about cats having nine lives,&rdquo; she
commented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Set that bag down,&rdquo; begged Anne, &ldquo;and
leave him alone. If he&rsquo;s not dead, he&rsquo;s at least
out of mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toughest bee I ever saw,&rdquo; commented
Katharine, thumping the bag again on the unlucky
insect. &ldquo;There you stay until we get to
our destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Mrs. Randall was on the porch waiting for
them when the car pulled up at the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought two extras, Mum!&rdquo; cried Patricia,
jumping out and hugging her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Randall, smiling
at her guests. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty lonesome around
here now, and Pat&rsquo;s friends are always welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the introductions were over, the irrepressible
Katharine said to their hostess, &ldquo;One
of our passengers is in there on the floor;
where shall I put him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Randall looked puzzled, while the girls
laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See?&rdquo; said Katharine, taking Mrs. Randall
by the arm, and showing her the bee crawling
along as if holding up heavy bags were just
pastime for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mrs. Randall, entering into the
spirit of the fun. &ldquo;Suppose you leave the door
open and let him select his own room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>As she spoke, the big black and gold fellow
spread his wings, blundered about a moment,
then sailed out past the girls who dodged him
with little shrieks and settled on a patch of
lilies of the valley beside the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the stowaway is disposed of, let&rsquo;s
go in,&rdquo; proposed Patricia, following her
mother up the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go right upstairs and get ready for
dinner, Pat,&rdquo; advised Mrs. Randall. &ldquo;Daddy&rsquo;s
coming home a bit early, and I thought we
would eat as soon as he gets here, so you girls
will have a long evening for anything you want
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother&rsquo;s a peach; isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; remarked
Anne, as the four girls went up the
long stairs together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; replied Patricia, smiling with
gratification. &ldquo;Now this is my room, and the
guest room is right opposite. We can divide up
any way you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we change around,&rdquo; proposed
Anne. &ldquo;Katharine and I will take the guest
room tonight; then tomorrow night we&rsquo;ll put
Jane in with Katharine and I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&mdash;wa! Ah&mdash;wa!&rdquo; lamented Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; demanded
Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have Pat at all, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you sleep all the time; so what difference
does it make?&rdquo; laughed Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set the alarm,&rdquo; offered Patricia in
amusement; &ldquo;and when the night&rsquo;s half over,
I&rsquo;ll go in, roll Anne out, send her over to my
room, and get in with you. How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll consider it,&rdquo; replied Katharine in her
most dignified tones; &ldquo;but I think my feelings
are irreparably damaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on!&rdquo; cried Anne, shoving Katharine
ahead of her into the guest room. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
never be ready for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Randall loved company, and was always
most entertaining whenever Patricia had
guests; so the dinner hour was prolonged to
such an extent that when the four girls reached
the theater, the early performance was well
under way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it over on the right,&rdquo; whispered Patricia,
as they entered the darkened house.
&ldquo;Just follow me,&rdquo; she added, ignoring the
usher completely and hurrying down a side
aisle. She was a bit careless in stepping up
into a row of seats, and turned on her ankle.
To save herself a fall, she grabbed madly at
the seat in front of her, which was occupied by
a very large and very dignified-looking man.
Instead of grasping the back of his seat, as she
intended, her hand came down very forcibly on
the top of his bald head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; he cried out in astonishment and
discomfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>Everybody within hearing turned around.
Several people exclaimed in annoyance. Some
nearby, who had witnessed the incident,
laughed aloud. In the general disturbance, the
girls managed to sink into their seats quite
overcome with embarrassment. Presently Anne
hid her face in her hands and began to quiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; whispered Patricia.</p>
<p>Anne only shook her head, and Patricia realized
that the girl was in a paroxysm of laughter.
It was contagious, and before long Pat and
Katharine were in the same state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; ordered Jane. &ldquo;Think of something
sad, and do it <i>quick</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With much effort and several relapses they
finally succeeded in pulling themselves together,
and fixed their eyes determinedly on the
screen, not daring to glance at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was just terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Jane in
mock anger, when they were out upon the street
again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never go to a movie with you
again, Patricia Randall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;awfully&mdash;sorry,&rdquo; gasped Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly act as if you were, quite overcome
with grief,&rdquo; said Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever in your life hear anything so
funny as the way that man hollered&mdash;he fairly
bellowed!&rdquo; said Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do get into more scrapes, Pat,&rdquo; commented
Anne, &ldquo;than anyone I ever met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Jane soothingly, as they
entered a confectionery store, &ldquo;you mean
well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Katharine, &ldquo;that is about
the worst thing one can say. &lsquo;Oh, he means
well.&rsquo; It seems like sort of damning with faint
praise. Not that Jane meant it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody laughed. Katharine was so unconscious
of her inconsistency.</p>
<p>While they were waiting for their order,
Patricia&rsquo;s eyes, which were roving about the
room in search of possible acquaintances, came
to rest on the back of a tall figure two tables
beyond theirs. As if compelled by her questioning
gaze, the individual turned around, immediately
jumped up, and crossed the room in
two strides.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />A WEEK END</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Craig!&rdquo; exclaimed Patricia, smiling up
at the lanky youth. &ldquo;Fancy seeing you here!
And what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here on business,&rdquo; was the brief response,
as he shook Patricia&rsquo;s hand enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are my friends&mdash;Anne Ford, Jane
Temple, and Katharine Weldon,&rdquo; continued
Patricia, &ldquo;who are spending the week end with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Acknowledging the introduction, Craig looked
inquiringly at Patricia. &ldquo;May I sit down here
and have my sweet with the Sweets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t possibly refuse after such a
&lsquo;sweet&rsquo; compliment as that,&rdquo; laughed Patricia.
&ldquo;How long are you going to be in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that depends. If I find what I&rsquo;m looking
for, I&rsquo;ll go back almost immediately; if I
don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll go Sunday afternoon, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How interesting and mysterious you
sound!&rdquo; remarked Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reporting&rsquo;s a great game. Now tell me
about yourselves,&rdquo; leaning both elbows on the
table and looking from one girl to another.
With flattering attention the boy listened to the
story of their drive home; gave a couple of
short barks of amusement at their movie experience,
then inquired what they intended to
do on the morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shop in the morning,&rdquo; replied Patricia.
&ldquo;I always do the Sunday marketing when I&rsquo;m
home. I just love to poke around the stores
and buy things. In the afternoon&mdash;I really don&rsquo;t
know yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would it be if you all went to the ball
game with me?&rdquo; proposed Craig, carefully
rubbing a drop of chocolate sauce off of his tie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand! But you&rsquo;d be embarrassed to death
escorting four females,&rdquo; laughed Patricia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it. I&rsquo;d be the proudest
fellow in the stand, and the most envied. That&rsquo;s
settled then,&rdquo; as all the girls manifested their
pleasure in the plan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call for you at two
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he added, as they rose to go. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
offer to see you home, but I suppose you have
your car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s in a parking station. Why don&rsquo;t
we meet you at the Park tomorrow afternoon
instead of your going way out to our house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea, especially as I haven&rsquo;t the
least idea where you live.&rdquo; Everybody laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;97 Minton Road, in case you ever need to
know,&rdquo; said Patricia, smiling frankly up into
the brown eyes and serious face above her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, making a note of the address.
&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; he added, taking hold
of her arm and steering her toward a candy
counter. &ldquo;Make up five pounds of the kinds
selected,&rdquo; he directed the prim clerk who came
to take his order. Then, waving off the girls&rsquo;
thanks, he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we each choose our favorites, to make
up one-quarter of the box?&rdquo; asked Patricia,
turning to the other girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine; and in quarter-or half-pound lots, so
as to get variety,&rdquo; said Katharine; and they
all assented.</p>
<p>It was rather late when the girls finally
reached home, but they settled down before the
living room fireplace with the box of candy, and
regaled Mr. and Mrs. Randall with chocolates
and the story of their adventures. Mr. Randall
finally drove them off to bed shortly after midnight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to stay in the car,&rdquo; announced
Katharine the next morning, when Patricia
drew up in front of a large department store
in the grocery department of which she intended
to make several purchases. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
care for marketing, and I do love to watch
people hurrying along the streets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you like it,&rdquo; replied Patricia, getting
out, followed by Anne and Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you park here?&rdquo; inquired Jane in surprise,
as Patricia slammed the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really supposed to, but I won&rsquo;t be long;
and I hardly think there&rsquo;ll be any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll entertain the cop,&rdquo; offered Katharine
magnanimously, &ldquo;if he shows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had been watching the crowd for about
ten minutes, when she noticed a big, red-faced
policeman approaching, his eyes fixed indignantly
upon the car in which she was sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m in for it!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Why in
time doesn&rsquo;t Patricia come? She&rsquo;s been gone
an age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t park here, lady,&rdquo; said the officer
sternly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you read?&rdquo; pointing to the
<span class="sc">No Parking</span> sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Katharine demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed the man in surprise</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word!&rdquo; was the reply, and Katharine
looked innocently at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nationality are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;American, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer pushed back his hat in perplexity.
He felt that something was wrong, but could
not quite put his finger on it. With all our
money spent on schools, and this young woman
couldn&rsquo;t read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyhow, whether you can read or not,
you can&rsquo;t park here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t my car, and I can&rsquo;t drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where <i>is</i> the owner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In there,&rdquo; pointing to the store. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be
out in just a minute. I think she went in to
buy&mdash;oranges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if she isn&rsquo;t out by the time I come
around again, she gets a tag; and that&rsquo;s flat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wrathfully the officer strode on, and Katharine
sank back comfortably against the
cushions again. Five minutes passed; ten; and
still no signs of Patricia. Katharine began to
fidget nervously and wish she had gone into the
store with the girls. Still, if she had, the car
would have been tagged at once; even now perhaps
she could stave the man off again if he
came around before Pat got back.</p>
<p>There he was, striding along as if he meant
business! &ldquo;I wish Pat and her oranges were
in Hades,&rdquo; thought Katharine, preparing to
smile sweetly at the irate officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t come yet,&rdquo; she said, leaning out
of the window and speaking confidentially.
&ldquo;Something must have happened to her. I&rsquo;m
<i>so</i> worried. What ought I to do, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Momentarily disarmed by the unexpected
greeting, the man removed his hat and
scratched his head. Then suddenly realizing
that he was being worked, he snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>could</i> happen to her except that, like
all other women, she has no notion of time!
This car&rsquo;s been here half an hour now. I suppose
she can&rsquo;t read either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been here only twenty-five minutes,
officer,&rdquo; corrected Katharine, showing him her
watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you can tell time, even though you can&rsquo;t
read,&rdquo; commented the officer, rather admiring
the girl&rsquo;s poise despite his annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; began Katharine, resting
both arms on the opened window, &ldquo;when I was
a little girl&mdash;(if I can only keep him interested
until Pat comes!)&mdash;I was&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off
to gesticulate madly to her friends who were
just coming out of the store.</p>
<p>The policeman wheeled sharply and saw
three girls racing madly toward him. Just as
Pat reached the car, the bag she was carrying
broke, and a dozen oranges rolled in all
directions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Katharine triumphantly.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you she just went in to get some
oranges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could the man do but help gather up
the fruit and toss it into the car? Scarlet with
exertion and embarrassment at the comments
of passers-by, he finally faced Patricia sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, you&rsquo;ve been parked here half an
hour, right under that sign. Can&rsquo;t <i>you</i> read
either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, a little,&rdquo; replied Patricia, with
a suspicious glance at Katharine. &ldquo;But those
signs are placed so high that if you&rsquo;re in a low
car, you really have an awful time seeing them
at all. You can see for yourself that this one
is directly over the top of the car. Get in and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is if you drive directly under
it!&rdquo; grumbled the man. &ldquo;And the next time I
see this car where it doesn&rsquo;t belong, it gets a
tag right away; whether your passengers can&rsquo;t
read, or you think the signs are too high, or&mdash;or
anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for your patience, and assistance,&rdquo;
replied Patricia, smiling at him in such a
friendly fashion that he had a hard time maintaining
his expression of outraged dignity. He
was still a bit doubtful as to whether or not
the girls were making fun of him. These
women!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Goodbye,&rdquo; called the irrepressible Katharine,
as Patricia stepped into the car and
started the engine. &ldquo;Hope I meet you again
sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer strode away without comment,
while Katharine reported her encounter to the
girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an absolute wreck!&rdquo; she declared in an
injured tone, as her companions laughed heartlessly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never keep car for you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own choice,&rdquo; retorted Patricia flippantly.
&ldquo;We wanted you to come with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the thanks I get,&rdquo; sighed Katharine,
&ldquo;for risking my life to protect your
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Policeman, spare this car; touch not an ancient
wheel!&rdquo; giggled Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In youth it carried me,&rdquo; continued Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll protect it now,&rdquo; carolled the three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to dump you all out,&rdquo; declared
Patricia in mock indignation. &ldquo;I know
it&rsquo;s not exactly a latest model, but it really
isn&rsquo;t so ancient as all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Patsy,&rdquo; said Katharine.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll ride in it, even if it is old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re going this afternoon,&rdquo;
remarked Patricia a few minutes later, pointing
down a side street; &ldquo;you can see the baseball
park from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Long before the game started, they were in
their seats watching the crowds pour into the
stands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>Patricia, who sat beside Craig, soon noticed
that he was scanning faces with more than
casual interest. When he pulled out a pair of
opera glasses with which to view the opposite
stands, her curiosity got the better of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for someone special?&rdquo; she inquired,
making pleats in her handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He moved closer, put his head down,
and spoke softly. &ldquo;We got a tip that the principal
in the Brock affair might be around here,
and my chief sent me out to see what I could
pick up. Keep it under your hat, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; breathed Patricia, quivering
with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come home to dinner with us?&rdquo; asked Patricia,
when the game was over and they were
headed for the parking station.</p>
<p>Craig shook his head. &ldquo;Like to a lot, but I
want to look around a bit more tonight; so I&rsquo;ll
eat in a one-arm lunch that I know about where
perhaps I&rsquo;ll overhear something. Thanks a
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d care to come, suppose you make it
tomorrow instead. We have dinner at one on
Sundays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to come then.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Any luck?&rdquo; Patricia inquired, as she met
Craig in the hall of her own home the next
noon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; looking so dejected that Patricia
could hardly keep from smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad; but don&rsquo;t be quite so downcast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good advice; perhaps I&rsquo;ll run across something
on the train. You get into a conversation
with strangers, and oftentimes a clew
slips out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner was a hilarious affair. Craig exerted
himself to be entertaining, and Katharine had
a silly streak which kept the company in gales
of laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to break away,&rdquo; said Craig, looking
at his watch after they finished their coffee before
the fireplace in the living room.</p>
<p>The day had turned cool, and a wood fire
was very welcome. &ldquo;This is awfully cozy,&rdquo; he
went on; &ldquo;but my train goes in twenty
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you let Pat tuck you into her
machine, and go back with the girls?&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Randall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like nothing better,&rdquo; replied Craig, unfolding
his long body slowly as he rose reluctantly
from a big easy chair; &ldquo;but I have my
return ticket, and &lsquo;Waste not, want not&rsquo; is one
of my mottoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you when you get back to town,&rdquo; were
his last words to Patricia, after taking leave
of the rest of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; she replied carelessly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>Had she been wise in inviting the boy to her
house? She wondered, closing the door. He
was inclined to be a bit possessive and might
think she was more interested in him than she
really was. But the end of the college year was
fast approaching, and with it a breaking off of
many Granard associations. Her face was very
sober as she rejoined the group in front of the
fire; for the fear of not being able to go back
next fall was a very poignant one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Pat?&rdquo; inquired Katharine
bluntly. &ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d just
buried your last friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the girl, perching on the
arm of her father&rsquo;s chair, and twisting his hair
into a Kewpie knot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat always looks like that when it&rsquo;s time to
leave home,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Randall, after a
searching glance at her daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to appear inhospitable&mdash;&rdquo; began
Mr. Randall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you think we should be on our way,&rdquo;
finished Patricia, &ldquo;so as not to be on the road
long after dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know it always takes longer than
you expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, darling; we&rsquo;ll get started. Come, girls,
get your things together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>When they were about twenty-five miles from
home, Patricia gazed anxiously ahead at a bank
of dark clouds, rapidly spreading all across the
sky. &ldquo;Afraid we&rsquo;re going to run into a storm,
girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as it isn&rsquo;t a thunder storm,&rdquo; began
Anne, in a worried tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough in a car if you keep out from
under trees,&rdquo; commented Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t, if you happen to be in the woods,&rdquo;
objected Jane, who was watching the clouds
gathering so rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to be in the woods,&rdquo; said
Patricia. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll strike the storm long before
we reach them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke a wave of chill wind swept
across the country as the darkness shut down
like the cover of a box, and huge hailstones
began to bounce off the hood and patter on the
top of the car with such force that it seemed
as if they must break through.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />A WEIRD EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to pull off the road and stop for
a while,&rdquo; declared Patricia. &ldquo;Trying to drive
in this is too nerve racking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shoulder was wide and smooth; so she
had no difficulty in finding a safe place to park.
In fact, almost any place would have been safe,
so far as traffic was concerned; for nearly all
drivers stopped to await the end of the storm.
For three-quarters of an hour the sky was
dark, while hailstones, big and little, pelted
down covering the ground with an icy white
carpet; then they ceased almost as abruptly as
they had begun. The sun was trying to break
through the clouds when Patricia started the
engine and turned out onto the road again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get as far as we can while it&rsquo;s pleasant,&rdquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, are we going to have another?&rdquo; inquired
Anne nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell for sure; but the sky looks pretty
black ahead of us. Maybe it&rsquo;s only rain
though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>She was right. Five miles farther on they
struck rain which was falling steadily as if it
meant to continue indefinitely. The road was
crowned and slippery, which made careful
driving advisable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing your father can&rsquo;t see us now,&rdquo;
remarked Katharine, as Patricia turned on her
headlights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it? Going to be dark awfully
early tonight. I don&rsquo;t like night driving any
better than he does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>None of the girls liked the prospect of driving
the rest of the way in rain and darkness.
The little party became a very silent one as
time went on, and even Katharine had almost
nothing to say. Only the windshield wiper
squeaked regularly as it swept back and forth
across the wet glass. At Braggs Corners a
couple of Boy Scouts stood in the middle of
the road directing traffic from Main to Pearl
Streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; inquired Patricia,
sticking her head out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bridge washed out. Have to go around by
Millersville,&rdquo; replied the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least twenty miles longer than this
route,&rdquo; groaned Patricia; &ldquo;and not so well
traveled. But, no help for it, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new route was indeed a lonesome one&mdash;a
country road through flat, drenched farm
lands, alternating with stretches of dripping
woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the lights, Pat?&rdquo;
inquired Katharine, after they had covered
about ten miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something, certainly, but I don&rsquo;t know
what,&rdquo; was the worried reply. &ldquo;They keep
going out. I&rsquo;ll just have to drive as fast as
possible while they&rsquo;re on, and slow down when
they go off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope they&rsquo;re on the job while we&rsquo;re in
these woods we&rsquo;re coming to,&rdquo; remarked Anne,
eyeing the dark tree shapes ahead with no inconsiderable
apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They probably will,&rdquo; said Patricia encouragingly;
&ldquo;and I think Millersville must be on
the other side of them. I&rsquo;ll stop there and have
the lights fixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls sat with bated breath as they
plunged into the gloomy woods, but all went
well until they had nearly reached the last of
the trees. Suddenly the lights flickered out, and
there was a terrific bump which jarred startled
cries out of all of the passengers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth was that?&rdquo; demanded Jane,
as Patricia slowed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hole, I suppose,&rdquo; replied Patricia with
feigned carelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it must have been an out-growing
hole,&rdquo; said Anne, rubbing her elbow which had
come into sharp contact with the window frame.
&ldquo;It felt as if we went over an elephant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely the limb of a tree,&rdquo; declared
Katharine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it was, it can stay there,&rdquo;
declared Patricia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going back to see.
There are lights ahead, and I&rsquo;m quite sure
we&rsquo;re almost in Millersville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Katharine, clapping her
hands.</p>
<p>With great care Patricia drove her dark car
into the little town, and stopped at the first
garage she came to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive right in,&rdquo; directed the mechanic who
came out to see what they wanted.</p>
<p>Inside the garage, the girls all got out of the
car and walked around while Patricia explained
her difficulties. After a hasty examination, the
man stood up facing Patricia sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady, there&rsquo;s blood and part of a man&rsquo;s
clothing on your car! You must have run over
someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; began Patricia indignantly;
then stopped short, clutching the fender
to steady herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; persisted the man.</p>
<p>Patricia forced herself to walk around to the
other side of the car, and saw a strand of grey
cloth twisted in the wheel, and stains on the
body of her car. They were partly washed off
by the rain, but enough remained to show that
it was blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That awful bump,&rdquo; offered Anne incoherently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t feel big enough for a man,&rdquo; objected
Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo; cried Patricia, biting her
lips to keep from crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better report it at the station, and get an
officer to go back with you,&rdquo; advised the man.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix your lights; then you drive on one
block and you&rsquo;ll see the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you go up with us and tell your part
of the story?&rdquo; begged Patricia, feeling very
much in need of male support in such an emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was the hearty response. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk
up and be there as soon as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Pat,&rdquo; said Katharine consolingly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to run over somebody
sometime, and now it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia shivered.</p>
<p>The mechanic was as good as his word, and
when the frightened girls entered the police
station, he was leaning on the desk in earnest
conversation with the officer on duty. The few
questions which were put to Patricia and her
friends were answered so promptly and frankly
that they made a most favorable impression;
and in twenty minutes, Patricia, was driving
back to the woods with a pleasant young policeman
sitting beside her. The mechanic and the
coroner followed in a small truck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> something!&rdquo; cried Katharine, as
they approached the scene of the jolting, and
the headlights showed a dark bundle toward
one side of the road. Patricia shuddered as she
saw that it was the figure of a man. As soon
as she had come to a stop, the policeman leaped
out and bent over the prone figure. With the
help of the coroner he rolled the body onto its
back, and made a hasty examination while the
white-faced, trembling girls watched from the
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ran over him all right,&rdquo; called the
officer.</p>
<p>Patricia gave a frightened gasp and clutched
the wheel tightly to save herself from succumbing
to a wave of dizziness which swept over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t kill him.
Somebody evidently stabbed and left him here.
His partner, no doubt. Probably took whatever
he had on him, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia breathed a prayer of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; continued the officer, as he
hastily ran his fingers through the pockets of
the dead man, and found nothing. &ldquo;Cleaned
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get him on the truck and take
him to the morgue,&rdquo; said the coroner. &ldquo;Give
us a hand, Jones,&rdquo; to the mechanic. &ldquo;Drive
ahead a little, lady, and give us more room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>Patricia moved on a few feet and discovered
that there was not space enough in that particular
spot to turn around; so she proceeded
slowly until she came to a place where the trees
were a little farther back from the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you can make it?&rdquo; inquired Jane,
lowering the window to watch the tree trunks
on her side of the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By going off the road a bit; it looks fairly
level here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took some maneuvering to get the car
headed in the opposite direction, and Patricia&rsquo;s
arms ached before the feat was finally accomplished.
Suddenly she stopped the machine,
opened the door, and jumped out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is the matter now?&rdquo; called
Jane, sliding over the driver&rsquo;s seat and sticking
her head out of the open door.</p>
<p>Patricia, who was stooping over something
a few feet ahead, in the glare of the headlights,
made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me there&rsquo;s another man!&rdquo; wailed
Anne, covering her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; assured Katharine, patting Anne
soothingly. &ldquo;Nothing so big as that. What did
you find, Pat?&rdquo; as the girl ran back to her
companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried, stumbling into her seat,
and holding up a glistening object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A watch!&rdquo; exclaimed the girls in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s Mrs. Brock&rsquo;s grandfather&rsquo;s
watch!&rdquo; Her words fairly tumbled over one
another in her excitement. &ldquo;At least it answers
to the description given in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pat, you lucky girl!&rdquo; ejaculated Jane,
hugging her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was right under the headlights. The
man&rsquo;s pal must have dropped it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! Maybe he&rsquo;s still around here!&rdquo;
shuddered Anne, as a dire thought occurred
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never thought of that!&rdquo; admitted Patricia,
starting the car again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear!&rdquo; asserted Katharine. &ldquo;A
criminal may return to the scene of his crime,
but he never stays there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better go back and tell the men, Pat,&rdquo; advised
Jane sensibly.</p>
<p>In a minute or two the girls were tumbling
out of the car, all talking at once to the officer
who was standing in the road waiting for them
to return. The body had been placed in the
truck, and the coroner and Jones were ready
to start off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One at a time!&rdquo; pleaded Policeman Tyne,
covering his ears with his big hands.</p>
<p>The other three girls stopped immediately,
and allowed Patricia to tell the story without
interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have lost this when he dodged into
the woods,&rdquo; remarked the coroner, who, with
Jones, had left the truck and rejoined the
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose perhaps he&rsquo;s keeping under cover
not too far from here,&rdquo; said the officer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Going in the woods to look for him?&rdquo; inquired
the coroner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least use in the world,&rdquo; offered
Jones promptly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d never find your way
around in there at night. It&rsquo;s bad enough in
the daytime. I got lost in there once. You&rsquo;d
just be a target for him, officer,&rdquo; he added,
as Tyne hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s probably miles away by now, anyhow.
We have no means of knowing when the crime
was committed. We&rsquo;ll go back, I guess, and
I&rsquo;ll make my report; then all surrounding
towns and roads will be watched. Ready,
girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations, Pat!&rdquo; said Anne, generously,
as they started off. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad
that you&rsquo;ll get the reward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo; began Patricia doubtfully,
watching the road closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; said the policeman. &ldquo;You found
it. Of course it will be held up for a while
until after the investigation, but then you can
claim it. Maybe there&rsquo;ll be a reward for that
fellow, too,&rdquo; nodding toward the truck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
pretty sure he&rsquo;s Crack Mayne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Patricia. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo; then
stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; demanded Frank Tyne suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Patricia forced an unsteady laugh, then told
the story of Jack&rsquo;s and her adventure in the
woods. The man shook with amusement over
the trooper&rsquo;s mistake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they took you for &lsquo;Angel&rsquo; and your
friend for Crack!&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;Wait till I
tell the boys that story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who on earth <i>is</i> &lsquo;Crack&rsquo; and what did he
do?&rdquo; demanded Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an A-1 burglar, Miss. Wanted for lots
of jobs, but he&rsquo;s so d&mdash; blamed clever that nobody&rsquo;s
been able to lay hands on him. They say
he comes of a good family; sort of black sheep,
you know. Somebody said he has a sister living
in Granard; of course that may be just talk.
He was in town a couple of times last winter;
that we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock up your class pin, Anne,&rdquo; laughed
Jane, as Anne&rsquo;s eyes grew bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he might try the dorm next,&rdquo; giggled
Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a horror of burglars. Imagine!
Waking up to find one in your room. Ugh!&rdquo;
shuddered Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s dead, you geese!&rdquo; Katharine reminded
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; sighed Anne with such evident
relief that they all laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s who Craig was looking for,&rdquo;
thought Patricia, as she made the turn into
Millersville for the second time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you suppose it will be?&rdquo;
asked Katharine suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reward, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed a bit hysterically; for the
events of the afternoon and evening had been
a severe strain on the nerves of everyone. The
truck turned down a side street, and as they
reached the station the officer got out without
waiting for Patricia to come to a full stop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck, girls!&rdquo; he cried, as he slammed
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping,&rdquo; said Patricia soberly, as she
put on speed, &ldquo;that the reward will be enough
to help me come back here next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve just <i>got</i> to come back!&rdquo; declared
Anne emphatically. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t possibly
get along without you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; agreed Katharine,
reaching forward to pinch Patricia&rsquo;s ear affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope you&rsquo;ll get enough to be of considerable
help,&rdquo; said Jane earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time will tell,&rdquo; replied Patricia, a bit
shakily.</p>
<p>It was wonderful of the girls to be so anxious
to keep her in the dear old Gang! She had
known, of course, that they liked her; but she
had never realized how much until she saw how
shocked they were at the possibility of her not
being able to return next September.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>The rain stopped, and traffic was light; so
they were able to make good time all the rest
of the way. It was about eight-thirty when they
drew up in front of Arnold Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s walk down to the Coffee Shoppe and
get some supper before we go in,&rdquo; proposed
Katharine. &ldquo;If the girls once get hold of us
we&rsquo;ll never get out again; and I&rsquo;m starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea,&rdquo; agreed Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to tell the Gang all about
our adventures?&rdquo; inquired Anne, as they
walked the short distance down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought so,&rdquo; replied Patricia.
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well,&rdquo; counseled Jane. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll
see it in the papers, or hear it some way; and
they would think it queer that we said nothing
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Rhoda!&rdquo; exclaimed Katharine, as
they entered the restaurant. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and sit
with her. She looks lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Rhoda,&rdquo; said Jane, sliding into the
seat beside the surprised maid, while the other
three girls squeezed into the seat on the opposite
side of the table. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t finished, have
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; just beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; approved Anne. &ldquo;Eat slowly until
we get our supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhoda obediently laid down her knife and
fork, while the girls ordered; then she asked:
&ldquo;Did you miss your supper at the Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say we did!&rdquo; said Katharine fervently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We had the most exciting time!&rdquo; cried
Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Rhoda,&rdquo; interrupted Patricia, leaning
across the table to whisper confidentially&mdash;&ldquo;Just
think; I found Mrs. Brock&rsquo;s watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Randall!&rdquo; gasped the maid. &ldquo;Wherever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; And Patricia plunged into the
story, aided by various comments from her
companions. Rhoda&rsquo;s eyes widened, and a deep
flush crept across her face as the tale reached
the discovery of the dead man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;awful!&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;What&mdash;what
did he look like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t look at him,&rdquo; responded Katharine;
&ldquo;but the officer thought&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off
abruptly, silenced by a sharp touch of Patricia&rsquo;s
sturdy shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were scared to death,&rdquo; interrupted Patricia
hurriedly, &ldquo;and glad to have a chance
to leave the scene for a few minutes. And
wasn&rsquo;t it lucky that I had to go farther on to
turn around?&rdquo; Rapidly, excitedly, she proceeded
to the finding of the watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s eat,&rdquo; proposed Katharine, when
Patricia paused for breath at the end of the
tale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>Rhoda merely played with her food, and
drank two cups of strong coffee, while she
waited for the girls to finish their meal. Then
they all strolled slowly back to the Hall together.
The moon had come up, and was shining
through the lacy foliage of the trees, making
delicate patterns on the walks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why the kick?&rdquo; whispered Katharine to
Patricia as they fell back of the others, to let
some people pass in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know for sure who the man was,&rdquo;
said Patricia; &ldquo;and it seems to me it&rsquo;s better
not to mention names. Let that come out in the
papers first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re probably right, Miss Prudence,&rdquo;
laughed Katharine; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t go quite so
heavy on the kicks hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was bedlam in Arnold Hall when the
girls told their story to the Alley Gang and
Mrs. Vincent in the big parlor. Students from
the second floor hung over the stair railings to
listen in; and before the subject was exhausted,
Ted Carter, Craig Denton, and Jack Dunn
walked in. Then everything had to be gone
over again.</p>
<p>Suddenly the outside door was flung open
impatiently, and Mrs. Brock walked in and
stood viewing the crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />THE REWARD</h2>
<p>For an instant nobody spoke or moved; then
Mrs. Vincent got up and crossed the room to
greet the unexpected visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come in and sit down, Mrs.
Brock?&rdquo; she asked, pulling forward a rocking
chair which Katharine had just vacated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not going to stay, thank you,&rdquo; was the
crisp response. &ldquo;Just came after my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the dickens did she know that it had
been found?&rdquo; whispered Anne to Frances, who
was standing beside her on the opposite side
of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; began Frances; then
stopped short, as Jane, who had heard the
question, looked back and formed the one word
&ldquo;Rhoda&rdquo; with her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where is it?&rdquo; demanded the old lady,
looking at Patricia as if she suspected her of
having sold it for old gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s at the police station in Millersville,
Mrs. Brock,&rdquo; replied Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; commented the old lady sarcastically.
&ldquo;Whatever possessed you to let it
out of your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I had to,&rdquo; faltered Patricia, somewhat
timidly. This fierce old lady was enough
to intimidate a far bolder person than Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to! Had to!&rdquo; began the caller, when
Jack spoke up in order to shield Patricia a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police take charge of all articles until
after a case is settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they do, do they? And who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Dunn,&rdquo; replied the boy, flushing at the
bluntness of the question.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brock gazed at him fixedly for a full
minute; then wheeled about and started for the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay a while, and have a cup of
tea with us?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Vincent hospitably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; was the curt reply. &ldquo;I get tea
enough at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened and closed, and she was
gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever!&rdquo; exclaimed Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; responded Jane promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word about the reward, either,&rdquo;
lamented Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope she doesn&rsquo;t forget all about it after
she gets the watch back,&rdquo; remarked Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Frances,&rdquo; interposed Patricia reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s so queer, who can tell what
she&rsquo;s likely to do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s forget about her and have that tea
you mentioned a minute ago, Mrs. Vincent,&rdquo;
suggested Ted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re getting it ready, we&rsquo;ll
run out and get some cakes or something to
go with it,&rdquo; proposed Craig. &ldquo;Come along,
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Vincent good-naturedly waived the ten-thirty
rule, and the rest of the evening passed
happily. So exhausted was everyone by excitement
and merriment, that heads were hardly
on the pillows when their owners were sound
asleep. Only Rhoda tossed restlessly, and fearfully
awaited the morrow.</p>
<p class="tb">Monday morning&rsquo;s paper contained a full
account of the discovery of &ldquo;Crack&rdquo; Mayne
on a lonely detour by several Granard students
who were returning to college after a week end
out of town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless his heart!&rdquo; cried Patricia, as she
read rapidly through the article.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose!&rdquo; inquired Anne. &ldquo;Crack&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Craig&rsquo;s. I begged him to keep our
names out of the paper, but I was afraid he
wouldn&rsquo;t. You know reporters just can&rsquo;t help
using everything they can get hold of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He owed you something, I should think, for
telephoning him the story right away for his
paper. He got a&mdash;what do they call it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Scoop!&rdquo; said Patricia, smiling at the recollection
of Craig&rsquo;s fervent, &ldquo;You darling girl!&rdquo;
when she had called him up from the Hall as
soon as they got in the night before. &ldquo;He was
especially sporting about it, since he was on
the trail of Crack himself when we met him
at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was? Now if he&rsquo;d only come with us
instead of going by train!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evening paper was not so considerate,
and the names of all the girls were mentioned,
along with the finding of the famous watch by
Patricia Randall who would, the paper stated,
receive the reward offered by Mrs. Brock. All
four girls would share in the $500 reward offered
for the capture of the burglar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capture is good!&rdquo; jeered Katharine, as the
Gang was poring over the paper in Jane&rsquo;s
room. &ldquo;Anybody could capture a dead man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Frances belligerently, &ldquo;if Pat
hadn&rsquo;t run over him you&rsquo;d never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest of her remark was drowned by a
burst of laughter; for Frances&rsquo; hostility was
as funny as that of a small kitten who arches
her back at imaginary foes.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, when the Gang came
in from lunch, Rhoda handed Patricia an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was left for you this morning,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Rhoda,&rdquo; said Patricia, smiling
in her usual friendly fashion; but there was no
answering smile on the maid&rsquo;s grave face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Rhoda?&rdquo; asked
Anne, as they went on down the hall to Patricia&rsquo;s
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; she isn&rsquo;t a bit like herself,
and sometimes she looks as if she&rsquo;d been crying.
I wish I knew what&rsquo;s troubling her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; perhaps we could do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was disturbing Rhoda would never
be revealed to the inmates of Arnold Hall.
Little did they suspect that &ldquo;Crack&rdquo; Mayne
was their maid&rsquo;s brother; that he had been the
one to rob Mrs. Brock of her money and jewelry;
and that, maddened by his sister&rsquo;s refusal
to give him access to the Hall, he had, in a
spirit of revenge, set fire to it. That was information
which Rhoda would keep strictly to
herself. Sorrow for her brother&rsquo;s violent death
was tempered by relief that no longer need she
shiver with fear each night as she wondered
where he was and what he was doing.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Open it quick,&rdquo; begged Anne, when they
were safely inside Patricia&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>Tearing open the envelope, she drew out a
sheet of note paper upon which was written in
an old-fashioned cramped hand: &ldquo;The promised
reward for finding my watch.&rdquo; Inside the
double sheet were laid five ten dollar bills.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations!&rdquo; cried Anne, jumping up
from the bed and flinging open the door.
&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; she called to the corridor at large,
&ldquo;Pat&rsquo;s got her reward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From all the rooms on that floor flocked various
members of the Gang to gather joyfully
around Patricia, exclaiming over the crisp new
bills as happily as if they were the property
of each individual there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go over and thank Mrs.
Brock, Pat,&rdquo; declared Katharine mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall express my gratitude in a very formal,
but sincere, note,&rdquo; replied Patricia, tucking
the bills into her hand bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to spend it!&rdquo; inquired
Clarice, who was wandering restlessly around
the room, examining articles on dressers and
desks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. Probably lay it aside for a
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might donate it to the scholarship
fund, and then this house wouldn&rsquo;t have to
take part in the annual entertainment to raise
money for it,&rdquo; suggested Lucile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do it!&rdquo; was Frances&rsquo; prompt
veto. &ldquo;Spend it on yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of our stunt for the 25th, we&rsquo;ve
got to have a meeting and decide what we <i>are</i>
going to do,&rdquo; declared Jane firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Pat and Jack do that dance they put
on the other night,&rdquo; suggested Anne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The very thing! It could be part of a
ballet,&rdquo; agreed Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; asked Jane, as Patricia looked
doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Jack will; but maybe he won&rsquo;t want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Betty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but you can never tell what
ideas a fellow has about that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope he agrees to it; for you&rsquo;re both
a peach of a dancer,&rdquo; commented Katharine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kay! Your English!&rdquo; objected Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. You know what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Jack today, will you, Pat?&rdquo; asked
Jane. &ldquo;Then we can build up the rest of our
stunt around you two. We&rsquo;ll need some of the
other boys, too; so Jack need not fear being
conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see him after Shakespeare class,&rdquo; promised
Patricia.</p>
<p>She was as good as her word, and reported
to the committee that evening that Jack had
accepted, after much urging. Rehearsals began
immediately amid great secrecy; for each
group tried to keep its contribution to the entertainment
a secret until the night it was presented.
Besides Patricia, only Anne, Katharine,
Hazel and Frances of the Alley Gang were to
take part, with Jane as director of the Arnold
Hall production.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are loads of better actors than we are
among the girls upstairs,&rdquo; was Jane&rsquo;s reply to
Frances&rsquo; protest at not having all the Gang in
the affair. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s only right to use as many
as we can. They think we&rsquo;re too prominent in
the house as it is, and it wouldn&rsquo;t look well to
keep the whole show to ourselves. They have
exactly as much right to be in it as we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances pouted, flounced out of the room,
and disappeared for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with her?&rdquo; inquired
Betty, who had collided with Frances in the
doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peeved because the whole Gang isn&rsquo;t to be
used in our act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must confess I thought you had your
nerve with you to leave Clarice out,&rdquo; commented
Betty, helping herself to a piece of
candy from a box on Jane&rsquo;s dresser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I have brought down Mrs. Vincent&rsquo;s
disapproval on myself; but while I have
nothing against Clarice personally, it seems to
me hardly fitting for a girl who is always behind
in her studies, and who has been quite so
talked about, to represent Arnold Hall in the
big entertainment of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jane always stands by her guns,&rdquo; remarked
Anne admiringly, as she shook out the
costume she was working on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How well I know that,&rdquo; laughed Ruth. &ldquo;I
have yet to see her back down from any stand
she has taken.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hate people who are always changing
their minds,&rdquo; admitted Jane, gazing critically
at a poster she was making for the entertainment.
&ldquo;Make a decision, and then stick to
it. That&rsquo;s my motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance, who the
ancient Greeks believed listened to the boasts
of mortals and promptly punished them, must
have made a heavy mark against Jane&rsquo;s name
just then.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />PAT&rsquo;S SACRIFICE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;But, Dean Walters, she does not seem
really bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been many complaints of her,
Mrs. Vincent, and her actions are causing most
unfavorable comment outside as well as inside
college circles. It is not desirable for the institution
to retain such a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that the crowd she was in
with for a while is largely responsible. I feel
quite sure that Clarice was not entirely to
blame in that last affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might it not have been better to have verified
your suspicions at the time, and brought
them to my attention, instead of waiting until
now to mention them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;she&mdash;she naturally would not wish to
betray her friends&mdash;and I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be that as it may, one more escapade will
automatically sever Miss Tyson&rsquo;s connections
with Granard College. I leave it to you to make
my decision known to the young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia drew a long breath of relief as the
two women left the library alcove next to the
one in which she had been an unwilling eavesdropper.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a noisy party on the top floor,
one night when the chaperon was at a concert,
had brought a shower of complaints from private
houses surrounding Arnold Hall. Exactly
who else beside Clarice had attended the
spread, no one knew; for she was the only one
who owned up when the matter had been made
the object of a very solemn house meeting a
couple of days later. The affair had crystallized
Clarice&rsquo;s standing in the Hall; for the law-abiding
students felt that the honor and reputation
of their house had been tarnished. Secretly
they wished that the ringleader might
be sent to room elsewhere, but gossip whispered
that the chaperon was especially interested
in Clarice by reason of a long-standing
friendship with one of the girl&rsquo;s relatives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>Patricia was sure, however, that underneath
the veneer of lawlessness, the girl was fine and
true. She was the only one who had &ldquo;owned
up&rdquo; and she wouldn&rsquo;t divulge the names of the
other culprits. Too bad she got in with that
crowd of girls who roomed outside of the
dormitories. They were less hampered by rules
and regulations, and gladly welcomed Clarice
with her generous allowance and her readiness
for all kinds of fun. She was always easily led
by anyone who was friendly toward her, and
on several occasions she had been taken advantage
of by the crowd. It was a pity that a girl
who was capable of doing good work, and possessed
of qualities which, if developed, would
make her amount to something, should be playing
around with those idlers who had come to
college principally for a good time. Somebody
really ought to rescue her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I might undertake the job,&rdquo;
thought Patricia reluctantly. &ldquo;Clarice responds
to flattery and petting like a pussy cat. Yet
even if I wanted to (which I really don&rsquo;t) I
haven&rsquo;t the time. It would mean constant attention,
and would probably ruin my standings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia shook herself, as if to be rid of the
whole troublesome business, and resolutely
opened her book. Next day&rsquo;s assignment was
difficult, and required perfect concentration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more escapade&mdash;sever connections&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Bother! Why need those relentless words
ring in <i>her</i> ears? It was the duty of Mrs. Vincent,
as chaperon, to advise and guard the girls
under her care. Inefficient little Dolly! The
only methods she knew how to use were reprimands
and warnings, neither of which would
do in this case. The redemption of Clarice
must be effected by one who would win and
hold her affection; who could, and would, detach
her from the outside crowd, and unite her
to the girls from Arnold Hall.</p>
<p>Patricia gave up further attempts to study,
and sat arguing with herself until a bell rang
and the janitor came in to close the building.
With a start she packed up her books, hurried
out, and walked briskly across the campus in
the direction of the Hall. The girls, unless special
permission had been granted, were expected
to be in the house at ten o&rsquo;clock, and it
was within a quarter of that hour. A passing
automobile forced her to pause at the corner
where a street light clearly revealed the faces
of the occupants of the car: Clarice and Bert
King!</p>
<p>Quick anger filled Patricia&rsquo;s heart. How
could anyone, with any sense at all, go right
out on top of a warning? She could not have
obtained permission, because all her privileges
had been used up. Calender Street led directly
out to Driftwood Inn, where there was a dance
every Thursday night. Evidently that was their
destination. No use bothering one&rsquo;s head about
a girl who was quite so reckless. A sheer waste
of time and energy!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>Thursday night? This was the evening that
the chaperons played bridge at the Faculty
Club. Possibly Mrs. Vincent had gone directly
there from the library. In that case, very likely
she had not yet seen Clarice. That put a different
face on the matter. Poor Clarice! Rushing
so gayly away to the Inn for a good time,
she would return to find herself expelled.
Hardly fair; yet the Dean had said distinctly
that one more escapade, and she always kept
her word. In view of her recent reprimand,
Mrs. Vincent would not be likely to spare
Clarice this time.</p>
<p>Mechanically Patricia entered the Hall and
walked down the empty corridor to her own
room. She was alone tonight; for Betty had
gone home for the week end a day early. Mechanically
she undressed, her brain busy creating
and discarding ways and means of shielding
the truant.</p>
<p>There was little doubt about Clarice&rsquo;s ability
to enter the house and get to her room unseen
and unheard. That she had accomplished before
by secret methods of her own. The greatest
danger lay in room inspection, recently inaugurated.
Every night, now, Mrs. Vincent
made a tour of rooms about eleven o&rsquo;clock to
see if any of her charges were missing. In all
probability, after the Dean&rsquo;s recent hint that
she had not been sufficiently on the alert, tonight
would be the time for greater thoroughness
than usual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>If there were only someone who could be
placed in Clarice&rsquo;s bed until after the ceremony
had been concluded. No one of the girls, of
course, would risk a demerit by absence from
her own room, especially for Clarice; they disapproved
of her too strongly.</p>
<p>Her own hair was almost exactly the shade
of Clarice&rsquo;s. There seemed no way except to
sacrifice herself to the cause, and she rebelled
against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is being deceitful, and that is wrong,&rdquo;
admonished an inner voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s being very charitable,&rdquo; contradicted
another little voice. &ldquo;By doing this, you&rsquo;ll give
Clarice a chance to complete her year&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And next year,&rdquo; came back the sneering
suggestion, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll act just the same as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing! You are going to help her
keep away from undesirable companions, and
develop her real self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact that she might not be back next
year herself was entirely lost track of in the
conflict between the opposing impulses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p class="tb">When she was all ready for bed, Patricia
opened her door quietly, paused to listen, then
slipped noiselessly along the corridor to Clarice&rsquo;s
room. Cautiously turning the knob, she
slipped into the dark room. Safe so far. Rolling
herself in the bed clothes, she turned her
face to the wall and burrowed deep into the
pillows. Shaking with excitement, and too
much disturbed to sleep, she lay listening to
the trolley cars and automobiles which passed
and repassed on the busy street, and to the
little movements and noises inside. She heard
Mrs. Vincent come in and go directly to her
own room. Finally the clock in the hall sounded
its soft chimes, then gave forth eleven measured
strokes. Like a cuckoo, Mrs. Vincent
promptly emerged from her room and crossed
the hall to the table where the register lay.
Presently, Patricia heard her put down the
heavy book and start along the corridor. Now
she was at Lucile&rsquo;s door; now Anne&rsquo;s; then
Patricia&rsquo;s own. A pause. Quick step around
the room. Return to the register. Silence.
Then the steps re-crossed the hall and stopped
at Clarice&rsquo;s door. The knob turned softly. Patricia
held her breath. Suppose, after all, she
should be caught, and Clarice&rsquo;s absence discovered!
The ray of a little flash light wavered
over her head, darted about the room, and&mdash;disappeared.
Half an hour later, Mrs. Vincent
was in bed, fast asleep; then Patricia crept
noiselessly back to her own room.</p>
<p class="tb">The students had just returned from breakfast
the following morning, when Mrs. Vincent
called Patricia into her room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Randall,&rdquo; she began, without preamble,
&ldquo;did you have permission to go out last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not in your room at room inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia was silent. The chaperon looked
surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo; she asked at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I am not at liberty to tell you; but I
can truthfully say that I was not doing anything
of which I should be ashamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You realize, of course, that I shall have to
report this to the Dean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Vincent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Baffled, rather annoyed, and wholly puzzled,
the chaperon dismissed her.</p>
<p class="tb">By dinner time that evening the whole college
seethed with the report that Patricia Randall
had been required to withdraw from participation
in the spring entertainment which
was to be given the following Saturday. Little
groups were gathered here and there excitedly
discussing the astounding news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, Patricia was out without permission
last night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one knew where!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her room was empty at inspection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dean Walters and Mrs. Vincent are furious
because they couldn&rsquo;t get her to say where she
was.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Dunn&rsquo;s terribly upset, because they
say she had one of the most important dance
numbers with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and nobody else knows how to do it;
and it&rsquo;s too late to coach anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a shame! That part will just have to
be omitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you suppose possessed Patricia,
of all people, to start breaking rules, and then
be so secretive about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In the little reception room of Arnold Hall
sat the object of their discussions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel just as bad as you do, Jack,&rdquo; she
was saying to the serious-faced youth opposite
her; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d explain if I could; but I really
can&rsquo;t. The worst of it is cutting you out of
the dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter&mdash;much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia was examining the pleats in her
skirt, laying each one carefully into its exact
crease. If only she wouldn&rsquo;t feel so like crying
every time she talked about the entertainment.
She had never been in anything as large as this
before, and was looking forward to inviting
some people down from home. How glad she
was that she had held up the invitations!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There <i>is</i> a way,&rdquo; she continued, as soon as
she could control her voice, &ldquo;that the dance
could be given just the same, if you will only
agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t make a solo of it, because it would
be a complete frost. Anyhow, I don&rsquo;t want to
go on without you. I need you for inspiration,&rdquo;
he added, with a mischievous grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice of you to put it that way, but your
desire to make the affair a success should furnish
enough &lsquo;inspiration.&rsquo; The omission of that
dance leaves an awful gap in the performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know it?&rdquo; gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, ask Clarice Tyson to take my
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As if shot, the boy sprang from his chair. If
Patricia had hurled a bomb at his head, he
couldn&rsquo;t have been much more shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; he exclaimed violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! Don&rsquo;t get so excited. Sit down and
listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The look of mingled astonishment and disgust
on his face was so funny that Patricia
almost had to laugh. Just in time, she succeeded
in choking back her amusement. This
was not a time for mirth; the case required
diplomatic handling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, Clarice is perfectly
familiar with that dance; and since she is a
born dancer, she won&rsquo;t embarrass you by ignorance
and awkwardness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not have a chance to,&rdquo; muttered the
boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; pleaded Patricia. &ldquo;Jack,
we&rsquo;ve been good pals for some time now; can&rsquo;t
you do this for me, if we must put it on a
purely personal basis? There is a special reason
why I very much want to place Clarice
before the public in a new role and under different
auspices. Your position in the college
is so solid, your reputation so&mdash;so irreproachable,
that what you do or sponsor meets with
the complete approval of the Powers-that-Be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baloney; but I&rsquo;m beginning, I think, to see
through your scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will do it?&rdquo; Eagerly the girl
leaned forward and waited for his reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take her by the hand and just drag
her onto the stage with me Saturday night,&rdquo;
objected Jack irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Tell Jane you know a girl
who is well able to take my place, and ask if
you may substitute her. Jane is so busy and
worried over the affair that she&rsquo;ll be delighted,
and probably will ask no questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack considered the question gravely, while
Patricia watched his face hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you, Jack?&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Please say
you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he agreed gruffly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not at
all keen, I must confess, at appearing so publicly
with the celebrated Clarice; but if you
say so, it must be done. Probably will cause
a tempest in a teapot, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rdquo; cried Patricia joyfully;
&ldquo;and thanks a lot. I&rsquo;ll do something big
for you some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack drew from his pocket a small note book
and scribbled a few lines on one of its pages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; asked Patricia curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just making a note of that promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the clock struck half past ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get out of here before I&rsquo;m put out,&rdquo;
said Jack, getting up and starting for the hall.
At the outside door, he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Pat, how does Clarice happen
to know that dance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I taught it to her this afternoon,&rdquo; was the
startling reply, as Patricia closed the door.</p>
<p>On her way to her own room, she stuck her
head into Jane&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack knows a girl he can get to sub for me
Saturday night,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Will it be all
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane jumped up with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
say so!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;Oh, boy! How worried
I&rsquo;ve been at the idea of leaving out that
dance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so very sorry to have made all this
trouble for everybody,&rdquo; faltered Patricia, with
tears in her eyes; &ldquo;but I just couldn&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, dear!&rdquo; whispered Jane, putting both
arms around the girl. &ldquo;The Gang&rsquo;s back of
you, whatever you do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good of you to say that, especially when
I can&rsquo;t clear myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe later on something will happen to
clear things up for you,&rdquo; suggested Ruth.</p>
<p>Pat looked at her quickly, wondering if the
girl suspected anything; but Ruth, who was
placidly combing her hair, smiled at her in the
mirror so innocently that her fears were
allayed.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Pat&rsquo;s shielding some one,&rdquo; declared Ruth,
after Patricia had gone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find
out who it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ruthie,&rdquo; groaned Jane, distractedly,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t suggest my doing anything until after
this blamed entertainment is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth said no more, but she made up her mind
that Pat <i>must</i> be cleared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />CLARICE</h2>
<p>Rehearsals for the ballet in which Jack
and his partner were featured had ended before
Patricia was banned; so it was not until Saturday
night that Jane discovered who the sub
was to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is <i>she</i> doing here?&rdquo; whispered the
harried director to Frances, who had sufficiently
recovered from her annoyance to help
with the make-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; inquired Frances, busy laying out
grease, paint, and powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice. She&rsquo;s out there on the stage as
large as life. We can&rsquo;t have any unnecessary
people back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Jack approached his partner, and
as they practiced a couple of difficult steps together,
the awful truth dawned upon Jane.
Though usually slow to anger, her temper suddenly
flared up at the trick which had been
played on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s just contemptible!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
rapping a brush sharply on the table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is the matter?&rdquo; inquired
Ruth, who had just entered with an armload of
costumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Pat and Jack to have given Clarice a
part in the dance without telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t ask Pat who
was to take her place. I wondered at the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed of its being Clarice! I
thought it was some friend of Jack&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; cried Frances. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
for nothing Pat&rsquo;s turned over her boy friend to
Clarice. It&rsquo;s my opinion that it is Clarice Pat
is shielding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just have a hunch, and I&rsquo;m going to ferret
out the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of that now?&rdquo; asked Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of use; for it would restore Pat to the
good graces of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we couldn&rsquo;t go out and squeal on someone
else,&rdquo; objected Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For cats&rsquo; sake, girls, stop talking and
get busy,&rdquo; pleaded the harassed director.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be ready for the curtain at eight-fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not until the very end of the long program
that the Arnold Hall girls went on. A
series of dances made up the scene, which was
in a forest. The dance specialty by Jack and
Clarice was just over when little Sylvia, the
niece of Dean Walters&mdash;as a lost princess&mdash;danced
to the front of the stage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>Excited by the crowd, she flung out her arms
and fluffy skirts as she came forward. A sudden
whirl brought her up against a torch held
by one of the woodsmen, and in an instant she
was ablaze. Like a flash, Clarice upset a huge
jar of daisies and rolled the child back and
forth on the soaked rug. While the curtain
was hastily rung down, Clarice picked up the
child and tried to soothe her. The fluffy
dress was a wet, charred rag, but Sylvia was
unharmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; choked Dean Walters, snatching
the child, &ldquo;it was the quickest&mdash;&rdquo; she began.
Then turning to Clarice, she said, &ldquo;Come in to
see me tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lucky I had to give up the part!&rdquo;
said Pat to Jack. &ldquo;I should never have known
what to do. And since the kiddie wasn&rsquo;t harmed,
how wonderfully it will help to reinstate Clarice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances, who was in the woodsmen&rsquo;s hut just
back of them, heard no more; but this much was
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarice,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Vincent, &ldquo;are you
burned at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied the girl, a bit shaky,
now the excitement was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ever could I have said to Albert&mdash;to
your father&mdash;if any harm had come to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, none did,&rdquo; said Clarice, starting for
the dressing room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s tired and excited,&rdquo; said Jane kindly,
as the chaperon&rsquo;s lips quivered and her
troubled eyes followed the progress of her favorite
across the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know anybody to act so
quickly?&rdquo; demanded Mrs. Vincent proudly.
&ldquo;Most people didn&rsquo;t know what had happened.
I guess the Dean won&rsquo;t be quite so ready to&mdash;&rdquo;
Realizing suddenly that she was saying too
much in her excitement, she stopped abruptly
and hurried off the stage.</p>
<p class="tb">The following day, Jane, Anne, Frances, and
Ruth were sitting on a bench in Reservoir
Park, facing the west. A beautiful sunset was
dyeing the sky a brilliant crimson and gold.
They had gone for a walk after dinner, and now
were resting and discussing the events of the
preceding evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very clear to me,&rdquo; Frances was saying
emphatically, &ldquo;that the Dean must have decided
upon something drastic regarding Clarice;
that Pat knew about it, and got into
trouble helping her out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then thought it might show the Dean
that the girls liked and trusted the real Clarice
if she had a big part in the show,&rdquo; continued
Anne, tracing a pattern in the dust of the path
with a small twig.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that she, herself, taught Clarice that
dance,&rdquo; contributed Ruth, who was industriously
pulling a daisy apart, meanwhile saying
to herself, &ldquo;&lsquo;He loves me; he loves me not.&rsquo;
Clarice told me so when I pressed the question
last night as to where she had learned it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane, who had been listening silently with
thoughtfully knitted brows and a puzzled expression
in her honest grey eyes, now sprang
up and faced the three on the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; demanded Ruth in alarm. &ldquo;Not
<i>measles</i>!&rdquo; In one of the dormitories there was
a mild epidemic of that disease of childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; laughed Jane, &ldquo;but listen! The
night Pat was missing from her room, I was
in the bathroom between ten-thirty and eleven.
You remember, Ruthie, I told you that the salad
we had at dinner made me feel sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruth nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I was in there, I heard someone
cross the hall and go very softly into Clarice&rsquo;s
room&mdash;it&rsquo;s right next to the bathroom, you
know. It didn&rsquo;t sound like Clarice, for she puts
her heels down so hard; and the person was
very quiet. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention,
or try to figure it out; I was feeling
pretty sick. But since you&rsquo;ve been talking, this
suddenly all came back to me. Do you know
what I think? I&rsquo;ll bet that Pat discovered
Clarice was out for a good time somewhere, and
took her room so her absence wouldn&rsquo;t be noticed.
Their hair is about the same shade, and
in the dark it would be easy to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Jane! Jane!&rdquo; cried Anne joyfully. &ldquo;I believe
you <i>have</i> solved the puzzle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Frances broke in, &ldquo;to what I overheard
Pat say last night!&rdquo; And she repeated
what she heard of Patricia&rsquo;s conversation with
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet the Dean intended to drop Clarice
if she got another demerit,&rdquo; said Ruth, when
Frances had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it fits right in with what Dolly started
to say last night,&rdquo; said Jane, nodding with
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now all we need to know is whether Clarice
was out after hours last Thursday,&rdquo; concluded
Anne; &ldquo;and when we get home, I&rsquo;m going to
ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if she was?&rdquo; queried Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;I think&mdash;&rdquo; replied Anne slowly,
&ldquo;that I shall tell her what we suspect. I was
with Clarice quite a bit the first of last year,
and got to know her fairly well. There&rsquo;s more
good in her than one would suspect, and she&rsquo;s
the last person who&rsquo;d let anybody else take her
punishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Anne,&rdquo; protested Jane, as they rose
to go. The brilliant colors of the sky had faded,
and it was beginning to get dark. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you
be undoing all that Pat tried to bring about?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, for the Dean had a long talk with Clarice
this afternoon, and they understand each
other perfectly. I imagine that Clarice was
quite frank about herself, for she told me the
Dean was just lovely to her, and regretted their
not having understood each other before. Clarice
has pretty much of a crush, and she&rsquo;ll do
anything for a person she loves. You see, Clarice&rsquo;s
mother died a number of years ago, and
Mr. Tyson has lived in boarding houses and
hotels ever since. He adored Clarice, and simply
spoiled her, until she became very headstrong.
Then he decided to send her to college
in the hope that its discipline and associations
would sort of make her over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Anne,&rdquo; interrupted Jane; &ldquo;if you
knew all this, why didn&rsquo;t you tell us before?
We might have helped, instead of sitting in
judgment on her so often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know <i>all</i> of it until this morning,
and you&rsquo;d never guess who told me. <i>Dolly.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dolly!&rdquo; exclaimed the other girls simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the break she made last
night about &lsquo;Albert&rsquo;? Well, I think she
wanted to explain that a bit; so she waited for
me after church, and on the way home told me
what I have just repeated to you. She met Mr.
Tyson and Clarice at the seashore, somewhere
in Massachusetts, a couple of years ago; and I
guess, again last summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why she&rsquo;s so fond of Clarice,&rdquo;
remarked Frances; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll bet my last dollar
she&rsquo;s fond of &lsquo;Albert&rsquo; too. Where does he
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, ha! She gets a letter from Boston
every week!&rdquo; cried Frances triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; demanded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you forgotten that I bring down the
mail at noon every day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane did not reply; for they were by that
time at the door of Arnold Hall. As soon as
they entered, Anne went in search of Clarice;
and nobody saw either of them again that
night.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />SOLUTIONS</h2>
<p>The girls of Granard College had finished
Monday night&rsquo;s dessert of chocolate blanc
mange, and were restlessly waiting for the signal
to leave the dining room, when Clarice, who
was sitting at the end of the Arnold Hall table,
rose quietly and stood facing her companions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got something to say, girls,&rdquo; she began
abruptly, her big black eyes turned on one after
another of the members of the Alley Gang, and
coming to rest on Patricia. &ldquo;Last Thursday
night I stayed out after hours without permission.
Accidentally Pat found it out&mdash;also, what
I didn&rsquo;t know at the time, that if I got another
demerit I&rsquo;d be dropped from college. Like the
good sport she is, she occupied my bed until
after inspection that night. You all know what
a jam she got into, but I was so dumb that I
didn&rsquo;t put two and two together until last
night.&rdquo; Clarice&rsquo;s fixed gaze here shifted from
Patricia&rsquo;s flushed face to Anne&rsquo;s. The friendly
smile which flashed to her from Anne&rsquo;s red
lips made her falter for a moment. Quickly,
however, she recovered her poise, and continued.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the Dean, and explained the
whole affair to her; as well as to Mrs. Vincent.
And, Pat&rsquo;s slate is clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarice turned from the table, and before the
astonished girls could move, had darted out of
a side door which was directly behind her.
Then pandemonium broke loose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Clarice and Pat!&rdquo; cried
Katharine, waving her arms excitedly.</p>
<p>An immediate and hearty response centered
the attention of the entire dining room upon
the Arnold Hall table; and as the girls left the
building they were besieged by the other students
to know the cause of the demonstration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>Although examinations loomed in the near
future, no one could study in Arnold Hall that
evening; everyone was too excited, and too
happy, to settle down. The members of the
Alley Gang roamed restlessly in and out of one
another&rsquo;s rooms, talking incessantly, while
sampling the &ldquo;eats&rdquo; which had arrived in several
boxes from home that day. Patricia had
managed to get Clarice for a few moments
alone in order to say some things which
couldn&rsquo;t be said in public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, Pat,&rdquo; protested the other girl.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so far in debt to you that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Clarice,&rdquo; interrupted Patricia, putting
her hand forcibly over her friend&rsquo;s mouth to
check further talk about indebtedness, &ldquo;I want
to know how things stand with you. You won&rsquo;t
be dropped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, everything&rsquo;s all right. The Dean was
lovely, and from now on I&rsquo;m going to make
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; began Patricia, &ldquo;and I know
that you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Anne appeared, and announced
that Rhoda had a telephone message for
Patricia.</p>
<p>Sliding off the porch railing, on which they
had been perched, the two girls followed Anne
into the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brock would like you to come right
over, Miss Randall,&rdquo; said Rhoda, when the trio
presented themselves before the Black Book
table where the maid was sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How exciting!&rdquo; cried Anne. &ldquo;What do you
think she wants?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go and find out, I suppose,&rdquo;
sighed Patricia wearily. The strain of the week
was beginning to tell on even her sturdy constitution,
and she longed to go to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back as soon as you can,&rdquo; begged
Anne, going as far as the door with her, &ldquo;and
tell us all about it. We won&rsquo;t have many more
talkfests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; and it makes me just <i>sick</i> to think of
leaving here the last of next week,&rdquo; whispered
Patricia sadly, dashing away a couple of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, old dear,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;Maybe
something will turn up to bring you back next
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">When the maid at Big House ushered Patricia
onto a large screened porch, she was astonished
to see Jack sitting beside a lamp whose
soft light illuminated the entire veranda. After
brief greetings had been exchanged, Mrs. Brock
said abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a story to tell you children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her visitors exchanged amused glances over
the appellation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it brief; for I know that the reminiscences
of old people bore the young. When
I was a girl, about your age, I had two very
dear chums: one was Mary Pierce.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>Patricia leaned eagerly forward in her chair
at the sound of her mother&rsquo;s maiden name, but
Mrs. Brock continued without appearing to
notice the girl&rsquo;s surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;was Gertrude
Neal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Jack started up in astonishment, as he,
too, recognized the name of his mother. Again
Mrs. Brock went on without a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That surprises you, for I seem much older
than your mothers. As a matter of fact, I <i>was</i>
several years older than the other girls, and a
long illness a few years ago makes me appear
much more ancient than I really am. But to
go on with my story. We were very congenial,
and almost inseparable.&rdquo; A smile at some
memory flickered across the woman&rsquo;s face,
completely transforming the immobile features
with which her listeners were familiar. A look
of regret and sadness almost immediately replaced
the smile, as she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, it was too happy a friendship
to last. We had a serious misunderstanding,
in which I was mostly to blame. In fact the
affair was the cause of considerable injustice
being suffered by Mary and Gertrude. I&rsquo;m not
going into details&mdash;it&rsquo;s over now, and they
probably forgot all about it; but anyhow, we
separated, and I have never seen either of them
since. An aunt took me abroad, and one thing
or another detained me there until last year.
My return revived old memories and affections;
yet my pride kept me from going directly
to my friends. I felt, however, that I wanted
to do something to make up, at least in part,
for the trouble I had caused; so I decided to
make you children a little gift and at the same
time find out what you were like. I bought Big
House because it was located so close to the
college my father attended, then sent you the
money for the year&rsquo;s expenses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rhoda, my secretary and companion, I
managed to place in Arnold Hall as a maid, so
she could give me all kinds of information
about Patricia; and I hired a private detective,
Norman Young, to do my secretarial work and
at the same time spy on Jack. The game is
played out now, and I hope the year has been
as satisfactory to you as it has to me. Wait a
minute,&rdquo; as Patricia again tried to speak. &ldquo;I
have an offer to make. I&rsquo;m going to get a car;
for I find I cannot walk as much as I used to;
and if Jack cares to take the position as chauffeur
in return for his next year&rsquo;s college expenses,
I fancy we can come to a satisfactory
agreement. The hours would not interfere at
all with college work, and,&rdquo; she paused and
looked questioningly at the boy, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t
have to live with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brock, I don&rsquo;t know what to say, except
to thank you for all your kindness to me,
and to accept gratefully your most generous
offer. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right then; that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; interrupted
Mrs. Brock, turning toward Patricia. &ldquo;I need
someone to look after my library and read to
me. If you could fit that work in with your
college duties, I shall be responsible for <i>your</i>
next year&rsquo;s expenses. Of course you&rsquo;ll live at
Arnold Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Brock,&rdquo; began Patricia; then much to
everyone&rsquo;s distress she burst into tears. &ldquo;If
you only knew,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;how much I
wanted to come back here, and how afraid I
have been that I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll expect you both to report here on
September 20,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Brock, &ldquo;four
days before college opens. Don&rsquo;t try to tell me
how grateful you are. I guess I know. Good
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia kissed the white face of the little
woman, and Jack followed her example. Neither
spoke until they were out on the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fairy godmother!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, isn&rsquo;t she wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the best of all,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;is that
we&rsquo;ll be here together again. You&rsquo;ve become a
sort of habit with me, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia smiled happily in the darkness.
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she exulted as they reached Arnold
Hall, &ldquo;I must go in and tell the girls the
joyful news.&rdquo;</p>
